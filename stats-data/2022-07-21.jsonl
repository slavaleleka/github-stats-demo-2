Creating the pull request\r\n\r\n> Please include a summary of the change and which issue is fixed\\\r\n> If the related issue does not exist in our repository, please create it before making pull request\\\r\n> It is highly recommended to use our [Web Reporting Tool](https://kb.adguard.com/en/technical-support/reporting-tool) instead of creating an issue on GitHub directly\\\r\n> Please note, that we verify every pull request manually, so it may take time to apply it\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n### To avoid invalid pull requests, please check and confirm following terms\r\n\r\n- [ ] This is not an ad/bug report;\r\n- [x] My code follows the [guidelines](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [syntax](https://kb.adguard.com/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters) of this project;\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own changes;\r\n- [x] My changes do not break web sites, apps and files structure.\r\n\r\n## What problem does the pull request fix?\r\n\r\n### If the problem does not fall under any category that is listed here, please write a comment below in corresponding section\r\n\r\n- [x] Missed ads or ad leftovers;\r\n- [ ] Website or app doesn't work properly;\r\n- [ ] AdGuard gets detected on a website;\r\n- [ ] Missed analytics or tracker;\r\n- [ ] Social media buttons — share, like, tweet, etc;\r\n- [ ] Annoyances — pop-ups, cookie warnings, etc;\r\n- [ ] Filters maintenance.\r\n\r\n## What issue is being fixed?\r\n\r\n### Enter the issue address\r\n\r\n* Fix #124800\r\n* Fix #124797\r\n* Fix #124798\r\n\r\n### Add your comment and screenshots\r\n\r\n#### If possible, a screenshot of a page or application should not be cropped too much. Otherwise, it is not always clear where the element is located\r\n\r\n0. **DO NOT** upload screenshots with sexually explicit material on GitHub directly.\\\r\n Instead, upload it to a third-party image hosting and post the link to it without preview (!) here.\\\r\n Also, mention if the link leads to NSFW content;\r\n\r\n1. Add screenshots of the problem. You can drag and drop images or paste them from clipboard\r\n\r\n    Use `<details> </details>` tag to hide screenshots under the spoiler;\r\n\r\n2. Describe the issue in detail until it is absolutely clear from the screenshot what the problem is\r\n\r\n    You can also indicate any other information that you think the developers should know.\r\n\r\n**Warning:** Please remove personal information before uploading screenshots!\r\n\r\n1. Your comment\r\n\r\nUpon analysis last night, it worries me that most `www.city.*.jp` sites would use *completely* different element trees and names, such that finding recurring patterns on more than 3 reported sites proved futile. And even then, `##a[rel=nofollow][href*=\"/ban/pub/default.aspx?\"]` was one of only three 3-site patterns I could find.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I'm adding `###fBanArea.floating` for the sake of `https://www.pref.saga.lg.jp/`\r\n\r\n2. Screenshots\r\n\r\nN/A (Covered by the original threads)\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not contain private info and all conditions are

Creating the pull request\r\n\r\n> Please include a summary of the change and which issue is fixed\\\r\n> If the related issue does not exist in our repository, please create it before making pull request\\\r\n> It is highly recommended to use our [Web Reporting Tool](https://kb.adguard.com/en/technical-support/reporting-tool) instead of creating an issue on GitHub directly\\\r\n> Please note, that we verify every pull request manually, so it may take time to apply it\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n### To avoid invalid pull requests, please check and confirm following terms\r\n\r\n- [ ] This is not an ad/bug report;\r\n- [x] My code follows the [guidelines](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [syntax](https://kb.adguard.com/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters) of this project;\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own changes;\r\n- [x] My changes do not break web sites, apps and files structure.\r\n\r\n## What problem does the pull request fix?\r\n\r\n### If the problem does not fall under any category that is listed here, please write a comment below in corresponding section\r\n\r\n- [x] Missed ads or ad leftovers;\r\n- [ ] Website or app doesn't work properly;\r\n- [ ] AdGuard gets detected on a website;\r\n- [ ] Missed analytics or tracker;\r\n- [ ] Social media buttons — share, like, tweet, etc;\r\n- [ ] Annoyances — pop-ups, cookie warnings, etc;\r\n- [ ] Filters maintenance.\r\n\r\n## What issue is being fixed?\r\n\r\n### Enter the issue address\r\n\r\n* Fix #124800\r\n* Fix #124797\r\n* Fix #124798\r\n\r\n### Add your comment and screenshots\r\n\r\n#### If possible, a screenshot of a page or application should not be cropped too much. Otherwise, it is not always clear where the element is located\r\n\r\n0. **DO NOT** upload screenshots with sexually explicit material on GitHub directly.\\\r\n Instead, upload it to a third-party image hosting and post the link to it without preview (!) here.\\\r\n Also, mention if the link leads to NSFW content;\r\n\r\n1. Add screenshots of the problem. You can drag and drop images or paste them from clipboard\r\n\r\n    Use `<details> </details>` tag to hide screenshots under the spoiler;\r\n\r\n2. Describe the issue in detail until it is absolutely clear from the screenshot what the problem is\r\n\r\n    You can also indicate any other information that you think the developers should know.\r\n\r\n**Warning:** Please remove personal information before uploading screenshots!\r\n\r\n1. Your comment\r\n\r\nUpon analysis last night, it worries me that most `www.city.*.jp` sites would use *completely* different element trees and names, such that finding recurring patterns on more than 3 reported sites proved futile. And even then, `##a[rel=nofollow][href*=\"/ban/pub/default.aspx?\"]` was one of only three 3-site patterns I could find.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I'm adding `###fBanArea.floating` for the sake of `https://www.pref.saga.lg.jp/`\r\n\r\n2. Screenshots\r\n\r\nN/A (Covered by the original threads)\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not contain private info and all conditions are met\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-20T07:36:12Z","updated_at":"2022-07-21T09:43:04Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"55a2f2688a6c0d06d18a8c96a9f58781c5025dcb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/pulls/124901/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/pulls/124901/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/124901/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/statuses/6aae025960c853943136f8c04e4fcad2d8205acb","head":{"label":"DandelionSprout:patch-13","ref":"patch-13","sha":"6aae025960c853943136f8c04e4fcad2d8205acb","user":{"login":"DandelionSprout","id":22780683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzgwNjgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22780683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout","html_url":"https://github.com/DandelionSprout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":146984364,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDY5ODQzNjQ=","name":"AdguardFilters","full_name":"DandelionSprout/AdguardFilters","private":false,"owner":{"login":"DandelionSprout","id":22780683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzgwNjgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22780683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout","html_url":"https://github.com/DandelionSprout","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DandelionSprout/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/DandelionSprout/AdguardFilters","description":"AdGuard

Creating the pull request\r\n\r\n> Please include a summary of the change and which issue is fixed\\\r\n> If the related issue does not exist in our repository, please create it before making pull request\\\r\n> It is highly recommended to use our [Web Reporting Tool](https://kb.adguard.com/en/technical-support/reporting-tool) instead of creating an issue on GitHub directly\\\r\n> Please note, that we verify every pull request manually, so it may take time to apply it\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n### To avoid invalid pull requests, please check and confirm following terms\r\n\r\n- [ ] This is not an ad/bug report;\r\n- [x] My code follows the [guidelines](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [syntax](https://kb.adguard.com/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters) of this project;\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own changes;\r\n- [x] My changes do not break web sites, apps and files structure.\r\n\r\n## What problem does the pull request fix?\r\n\r\n### If the problem does not fall under any category that is listed here, please write a comment below in corresponding section\r\n\r\n- [x] Missed ads or ad leftovers;\r\n- [ ] Website or app doesn't work properly;\r\n- [ ] AdGuard gets detected on a website;\r\n- [ ] Missed analytics or tracker;\r\n- [ ] Social media buttons — share, like, tweet, etc;\r\n- [ ] Annoyances — pop-ups, cookie warnings, etc;\r\n- [ ] Filters maintenance.\r\n\r\n## What issue is being fixed?\r\n\r\n### Enter the issue address\r\n\r\n* Fix #124800\r\n* Fix #124797\r\n* Fix #124798\r\n\r\n### Add your comment and screenshots\r\n\r\n#### If possible, a screenshot of a page or application should not be cropped too much. Otherwise, it is not always clear where the element is located\r\n\r\n0. **DO NOT** upload screenshots with sexually explicit material on GitHub directly.\\\r\n Instead, upload it to a third-party image hosting and post the link to it without preview (!) here.\\\r\n Also, mention if the link leads to NSFW content;\r\n\r\n1. Add screenshots of the problem. You can drag and drop images or paste them from clipboard\r\n\r\n    Use `<details> </details>` tag to hide screenshots under the spoiler;\r\n\r\n2. Describe the issue in detail until it is absolutely clear from the screenshot what the problem is\r\n\r\n    You can also indicate any other information that you think the developers should know.\r\n\r\n**Warning:** Please remove personal information before uploading screenshots!\r\n\r\n1. Your comment\r\n\r\nUpon analysis last night, it worries me that most `www.city.*.jp` sites would use *completely* different element trees and names, such that finding recurring patterns on more than 3 reported sites proved futile. And even then, `##a[rel=nofollow][href*=\"/ban/pub/default.aspx?\"]` was one of only three 3-site patterns I could find.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I'm adding `###fBanArea.floating` for the sake of `https://www.pref.saga.lg.jp/`\r\n\r\n2. Screenshots\r\n\r\nN/A (Covered by the original threads)\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I agree that pull request does not contain private info and all conditions are

rare\r\n- `(?:[a-z0-9]{2}\\/)` repeated only two times is rare\r\n\r\nAlso the original regex put in specific.txt seems to be only historical reason, they are generic pattern so moved to

Add screenshots of the problem. You can drag and drop images or paste them from clipboard\r\n\r\n    Use `<details> </details>` tag to hide screenshots under the spoiler;\r\n\r\n2.

Your comment\r\n\r\nI don't know whether `(?:www\\.)?` works on CB so didn't add. Tell me if it works. I concentrated on covering as much targets by as simple regex as possible.\r\n\r\n- Almost 100% of them now use .com domain\r\n- There are certainly cases starting from www or pl******* but rather rare\r\n- `(?:[a-z0-9]{2}\\/)` repeated only two times is rare\r\n\r\nAlso the original regex put in specific.txt seems to be only historical reason, they are generic pattern so moved to

Your comment\r\n\r\nI don't know whether `(?:www\\.)?` works on CB so didn't add. Tell me if it works. I concentrated on covering as much targets by as simple regex as possible.\r\n\r\n- Almost 100% of them now use .com domain\r\n- There are certainly cases starting from www or pl******* but rather rare\r\n- `(?:[a-z0-9]{2}\\/)` repeated only two times is rare\r\n\r\nAlso the original regex put in specific.txt seems to be only historical reason, they are generic pattern so moved to
