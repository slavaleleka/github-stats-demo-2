\r\n> iOSのSafariのリーダー表示によれば、次のような文字列が埋め込まれているようです。\r\n> 広告の表示を許可してください：広告がブロックされている場合、画像の表示などの機能が制限されます。\r\n> ロケットニュース24では、広告が記事閲覧を邪魔しないように心がけ、問題のある広告が表示されないよう日々メンテナンスしています。\r\n>

\r\n> iOSのSafariのリーダー表示によれば、次のような文字列が埋め込まれているようです。\r\n> 広告の表示を許可してください：広告がブロックされている場合、画像の表示などの機能が制限されます。\r\n> ロケットニュース24では、広告が記事閲覧を邪魔しないように心がけ、問題のある広告が表示されないよう日々メンテナンスしています。\r\n>
