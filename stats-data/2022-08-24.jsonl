Issue URL (Ads)\r\n [https://www.twitch.tv/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twitch.tv%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\nUsername: @Nikos-96\r\n> С недавнего времени начала появляться реклама перед каждым стримом. Если обновить страницу, то снова появляется. На самом деле это не совсем реклама, а просто картинка, как на скриншоте, висит где-то секунд 15 и потом начинается стрим. Самой рекламы как таковой нет. Также я заметил, что это происходит только если смотреть с аккаунта. Если выйти из аккаунта или открыть стрим в режиме инкогнито, то всё нормально. Дело не в расширениях, которые не работают в этом режиме, а именно в аккаунте на твиче, я это проверил. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/lVFqeXm.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.10.2\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | TDI\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Hide your User-Agent ()\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `quic://dns.adguard.com`<br>filters: `User+rules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nOther extensions used: | антивирус dr.web security space 12.0","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1225890949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-08-24T15:35:55Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
