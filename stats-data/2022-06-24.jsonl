There is a complication here. Block does not work regardless of whether the custom rule (user filter) is on or off. It does not work on all sites with any user rule. I also have Adguard Home on my router. The only way to solve it at the moment is to run Adguard Blocker (not Adguard Assistant) at the same time. With importing the same rules into the user filter it  works fine.
