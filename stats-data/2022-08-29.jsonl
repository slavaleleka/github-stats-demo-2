AdGuard，爱奇艺（https://www.iqiyi.com/）网站首页右侧的推荐列表可以根据鼠标的移动切换变大。开启 AdGuard，则推荐列表无法切换变大。\n> \n> 与【扰人的】有关，我开启了5项：\n> \n> AdGuard 恼人广告过滤器\n> Adblock Warning Removal List\n> Fanboy's Annoyances\n> Web Annoyances Ultralist\n> 我不在乎 cookies\n> \n> 单独开启哪项都会出问题，请解决，谢谢！\n> \n> With AdGuard turned off, the recommendation list on the right side of the homepage of iQiyi (https://www.iqiyi.com/) can be enlarged by switching the mouse pointer. If AdGuard is enabled, the recommendation list cannot be toggled and enlarged.\n> \n> Related to annoying, I have turned on 5 items:\n> \n> AdGuard Annoying AD filter\n> Adblock Warning Removal List\n> Fanboy's Annoyances\n> Web Annoyances Ultralist\n> I don't care about cookies\n> \n> If you open any item alone, it will cause problems.
