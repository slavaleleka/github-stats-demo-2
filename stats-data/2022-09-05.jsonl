Since an update about 3 weeks ago, whenever I try to access the leaflet (the supermarket catalogue) from within the app get a network error. If I revert the phone to my ISP DNS, the app works normal, so I guess it is a bad AdGuard filter. Can you please fix it?

Comment\r\nUsername: @jpgredwine\r\n> I am entering sweepstakes on the Publishers Clearing House website, specially this:\r\n> https://www.pch.com/sweepstakes\r\n> For whatever reason during the past week or two , it seems like these ads appear to the right, left, atop and even once over the playing area of the sweepstakes.   Maybe it has something to do with the way that Apple had updated their Operating System these past few weeks?  I don't know, but I do know that Publishers Clearing House had a lot of issues on their games on the Apple iPhones, but I didn't hear of any on the Apple MacBookPro specifically.    \r\n> \r\n> I copied the image address of one of the ads in a different sweepstakes that they have and it says:\r\n> \r\n> https://public.servenobid.com/creatives/MzAweDYwMC0yLmpwZ18xMDk4\r\n> \r\n> I don't  know what this even means.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/vV9Z54d.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/uVCgpGh.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.7\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances\r\nOther extensions used: | Norton™ 360 with LifeLock™ Ultimate Plus","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/128959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/128959/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1237024017","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/128959#issuecomment-1237024017","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/128959","id":1237024017,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85Ju30R","user":{"login":"jellizaveta","id":91964807,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXtFhw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91964807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta","html_url":"https://github.com/jellizaveta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-05T13:24:27Z","updated_at":"2022-09-05T13:24:27Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@jpgredwine Unfortunately, I am not able to view ads on this site at the moment.

Since an update about 3 weeks ago, whenever I try to access the leaflet (the supermarket catalogue) from within the app get a network error. If I revert the phone to my ISP DNS, the app works normal, so I guess it is a bad AdGuard filter. Can you please fix it?
