is pretty much their built-in player that is packed with ads and barely any useful information, I was talking about.\r\n\r\nI think that it doesn't matter if it's their video player or not, because as I said it's related to content, this is Red Dead Redemption 2 review and these videos are gameplays from this game, so might be useful for some users.\r\nYouTube and Twitch players contains ads too, it doesn't mean that those players should be blocked.\r\n\r\n>When you close the popup, you pretty much accepting all the tracking that comes with it, so yes, is entirely different from blocking.\r\n\r\nIt's a different thing not related to Annoyances filter, trackers are still blocked by Tracking Protection filter and we don't want to break websites.\r\nIf user will notice that video player doesn't work and she/he will want to watch it then she/he will just disable an ad blocker, what is worst than automatically closed cookie notice (it's impossible to make everyone happy).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1266907352/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-10-04T12:21:59Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\nUsername: @bsitshort\r\n> There has always been an issue with ads on edge home screen. In the past it would filter them, but as you scroll down they would eventually come back. I could go to the adguard extension and click on it and without doing anything they would dissapear again. Rinse and repeat.  But in the last few weeks they aren't filtered at all.  When you try to block them manually, it blanks out the whole page. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

Comment\r\nUsername: @bsitshort\r\n> There has always been an issue with ads on edge home screen. In the past it would filter them, but as you scroll down they would eventually come back. I could go to the adguard extension and click on it and without doing anything they would dissapear again. Rinse and repeat.  But in the last few weeks they aren't filtered at all.  When you try to block them manually, it blanks out the whole page. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/qmrBRsf.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.10.2\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns-unfiltered.adguard.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `User+rules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Japanese\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Norton Security, Autoplay Stopper, Google Keep, Dark Reader","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130500/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-10-04T11:32:32Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
