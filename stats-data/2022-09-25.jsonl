meant that in general Extended CSS rules are slower than simple cosmetic/element hiding rules, because the former need to run additional JavaScript code to hide elements.\r\nSo, instead of using something like:\r\n```adblock\r\n#?#:xpath(/html/body/div[*]/div/div/div/section)\r\n```\r\nsomething like this could be used:\r\n```adblock\r\n##html >body > div:not(:empty) > div > div > div > section\r\n```\r\nIt should hides the same element(s) and should do this faster and it will require less resources.\r\n\r\nBy the way, you can use [selectors debug mode](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/ExtendedCss#selectors-debug-mode) or [ExtendedCss.query](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/ExtendedCss#debugging-extended-selectors) to check performance of the rules.\r\n\r\nFor example, for these rules:\r\n```adblock\r\ngoogle.com#?#html > body > div > div > div > img\r\ngoogle.com#?#:xpath(/html/body/div/div/div/img)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth rules are Extended CSS rules and if I understand correctly, `:xpath` rule required 2.9 ms, but not `:xpath` rule required 1.5 ms.\r\n<details><summary>Screenshot</summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29142494/192143384-55221f4e-4323-44a8-b983-0c9de5c9c0d9.png)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nAnyway, in case like this, it would be better to use not Extended CSS rule:\r\n```adblock\r\ngoogle.com##html > body > div > div > div > img\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1257184892/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-09-25T12:36:50Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
