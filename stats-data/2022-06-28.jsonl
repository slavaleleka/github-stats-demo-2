It also take my time, to check a page, point to an issue and thats the result. I feel pranked.\r\nWhy my reports stay closed when I report that there is still an issue? Why I need to escalate several times to get reports serious? (especially for the big pages like Google, YouTube etc.)\r\n\r\nInstagram? I don't care and I don't use it. F* Zuckerberg. I report things to make the internet better and people enjoy AdGuard, because I like it. It's up to you, if you prefer that users delete AdGuard, because it breaks major pages.\r\nI have even linked to another ticket where the same issue existed.\r\n\r\nThe TOTP 'breaking' rule is: `instagram.com#$?#body > div[role=\"presentation\"]:has(> div[role=\"dialog\"] a[href=\"/legal/cookies/\"]) { display: none!important; }`\r\nAfter disable the rule and manually deny Cookies, TOTP is working.
