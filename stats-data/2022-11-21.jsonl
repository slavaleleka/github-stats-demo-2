Lyft rideshare links sent via text to track the location of a ride. If someone shared the status of their ride with me, an AdGuard user, the page will show the error in image #1. Refreshing the page or closing the notification doesn't restore functionality. I did not have a second screenshot handy showing behavior with AdGuard off, however I did test it 11/9/22 and shared links worked as intended. This issue has persisted since I initially subscribed to AdGuard sometime in 9/22. No settings have been changed since. \r\n> \r\n> AdGuard also breaks the \"live map\" when scheduling a ride too. It's the little map above the \"from\" and \"to\" address fields. Instead of showing a detailed map, it's a blank square. Would have created a separate ticket for it but I don't need a ride at this moment. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/m09T4eW.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/f9StHoH.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13 11/5 Security Update\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.0 nightly 35 (79)\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | \r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS (Default)`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS filter (Default)`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Extra\r\nDisable AMP","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/134814/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/134814/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-11-21T10:38:15Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
