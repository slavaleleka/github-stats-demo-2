Мне это надоело, я решила полазить в настройках вашего приложения, вдруг найду что-то полезное. Наклацала непонятно что, вроде вернула все обратно, но теперь вылезла проблема - законные две рекламы вернулись к моим просмотрам сериалов и фильмов. При этом на самом сайте много всплывающих окон и баннеров, их по прежнему не видно. Что я наклацала не знаю, в самом сафари расширение включено, с настроек все включено, если в приложение зайти то там стоит защита сафари включена. А по факту лажа.

我已经失去耐心了，也许是我电脑某个软件导致的，也许不是AdGuard导致的，也许是AdGuard与我电脑的某个软件一起导致的。 无论如何，我已经放弃了，因为我准备重新安装windows，希望问题可以得到解决。\r\n> \r\n> 非常感谢 @Alex-302 @adguard-bot @ilvjyw 你们真的很认真，致敬！\r\n\r\n有可能是破站播放器的 视频格式问题 你在播放设置里面
