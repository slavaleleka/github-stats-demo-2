Мне это надоело, я решила полазить в настройках вашего приложения, вдруг найду что-то полезное. Наклацала непонятно что, вроде вернула все обратно, но теперь вылезла проблема - законные две рекламы вернулись к моим просмотрам сериалов и фильмов. При этом на самом сайте много всплывающих окон и баннеров, их по прежнему не видно. Что я наклацала не знаю, в самом сафари расширение включено, с настроек все включено, если в приложение зайти то там стоит защита сафари включена. А по факту лажа.

我已经失去耐心了，也许是我电脑某个软件导致的，也许不是AdGuard导致的，也许是AdGuard与我电脑的某个软件一起导致的。 无论如何，我已经放弃了，因为我准备重新安装windows，希望问题可以得到解决。\r\n> \r\n> 非常感谢 @Alex-302 @adguard-bot @ilvjyw 你们真的很认真，致敬！\r\n\r\n有可能是破站播放器的 视频格式问题 你在播放设置里面

Comment\r\nUsername: @tox1c90\r\n> I think I understand now what the problem is that in some cases Bing ads are slipping through. Just noticed by chance that ALL of my search results are served as IMAGES/blobs instead of text. Only the headlines and URLs can be selected and copied as text, the actual preview of each result including the \"ad\" marker is contained in an image object, if you try to select the text with your mouse/cursor one actually drags the whole thing around.\r\n> This is not only the case for ads, but for all search results when Adguard is enabled.\r\n> \r\n> In inPrivate mode of the browser, this does not happen, and all search results are served as proper selectable text. And then, Adguard is able to block all ads.\r\n> \r\n> So the ads are obviously not missed by the filter, but it's Bing running some kind of Adblock detection, which switches the way search results are delivered from text mode to small inline images/snippets/blobs.\r\n> \r\n> Anything one can do to get around this? Better way of hiding Adguard?\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/RuaiVmm.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/tkZXG28.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/bgFJI5O.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.11\r\nBrowser: | Edge 106.0.1370.52 (Chromium-based)\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard German\r\nUserscripts: | https://greasyfork.org/scripts/5357-remove-google-results-redirect/code/Remove%20Google%20Results%20Redirect.user.js,<br>https://greasyfork.org/scripts/18450-steam-bypass-age-confirmation-prompts/code/Steam:%20Bypass%20age%20confirmation%20prompts.user.js,<br>https://greasyfork.org/scripts/383093-twitch-disable-automatic-video-downscale/code/Twitch%20-%20Disable%20automatic%20video%20downscale.user.js,<br>C:\\Users\\marti\\OneDrive\\Anwendungen\\Adguard\\Youtube%201440p.user.js,<br>https://nightdev.com/betterttv/other/betterttv.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-wot/1.0/wot.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://www.bing.com/search?q=fritz+dect+302&cvid=cf581884581c4bc88fd942687290bf5c&aqs=edge.1.69i60j69i59j0j69i57j69i59j0l2j69i60l2.1289j0j9&PC=U531&first=1&FORM=PERE](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bing.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dfritz%2Bdect%2B302%26cvid%3Dcf581884581c4bc88fd942687290bf5c%26aqs%3Dedge.1.69i60j69i59j0j69i57j69i59j0l2j69i60l2.1289j0j9%26PC%3DU531%26first%3D1%26FORM%3DPERE)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133445/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1295896282","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133445#issuecomment-1295896282","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133445","id":1295896282,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85NPc7a","user":{"login":"tox1c90","id":43222297,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjIyMjk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43222297?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tox1c90","html_url":"https://github.com/tox1c90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tox1c90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tox1c90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tox1c90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tox1c90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tox1c90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tox1c90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tox1c90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tox1c90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tox1c90/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-29T16:41:22Z","updated_at":"2022-10-29T16:41:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I did a few tests inside of a VM.

Adguard has ceased filtering on certain sites for some reason. When clicking on my Adguard Browser Assistant icon, it shows the message “Protection is disabled | Filtering is disabled because it may affect the website’s performance” with seemingly no way to force it on – v. screenshot here: https://i.imgur.com/vmTIX7n.png \r\n> \r\n> I appreciate the app taking the initiative when it detects it may break or unduly harm the user’s browsing experience. In this case in particular though, Adguard refuses to filter on Reddit, whereas I did not go through any browsing issues in the past. I don’t know if this behavior came to be as of a recent Adguard update, or if I may have unintentionally triggered it by creating some custom filters – both happened lately. If I were to guess I’d say it got like this in a week or so. \r\n> \r\n> Reddit is the only site I visit often where Adguard behaves like this, from the top of my head. \r\n> \r\n> Thanks!\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/ydsVvid.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/vg9l7XU.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v7.11\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese\r\nCustom filters: | custom","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1295936330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-10-29T18:54:28Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
