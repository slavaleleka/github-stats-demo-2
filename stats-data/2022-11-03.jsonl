Username: @PedroSaldanha\r\n> \r\n> > Com o AdGuard ativado a navegação fica pesada e lenta chegando até a deixar o navegador como um todo menos responsivo. Aparentemente começa quando abro um vídeo em Miniplayer no YouTube e vou descendo a página e apontando o mouse para a pré visualização dos vídeos, uma hora a página mal carrega imagens. Com o AdGuard desativado tudo funciona normalmente.\r\n> \r\n> ### Screenshots\r\n> Screenshot 1\r\n> \r\n> ![Screenshot 1](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/7a550870a45bfde1cf088b0aab221fc3a742dad52cfe1f33c10074aef7d028bd/68747470733a2f2f7265706f7274732d696d672e616467756172642e636f6d2f6a3950625255362e706e67)\r\n> Screenshot 2\r\n> \r\n> ![Screenshot 2](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/68157d2550fc0bce295393be7abebe6d6040af9864c48e7944c58020d6ace163/68747470733a2f2f7265706f7274732d696d672e616467756172642e636f6d2f3061595a3539552e6a7067)\r\n> ### System configuration\r\n> Information \tvalue\r\n> AdGuard product: \tAdGuard Browser extension v4.1.39\r\n> Browser: \tFirefox\r\n> Stealth mode: \tdisabled\r\n> Filters: \tAd Blocking:\r\n> AdGuard Base\r\n> \r\n> Annoyances:\r\n> AdGuard Annoyances\r\n> \r\n> Language-specific:\r\n> AdGuard Chinese,\r\n> AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese\r\n> Other extensions used: \tSponsorblock\r\n\r\nI'm using Firefox 102.4.0 ESR if it is some important info.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1301795116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-11-03T08:48:06Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

@BlazDT _(and @zloyden)_,\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>﹥Similar to https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/131213#issuecomment-1266935078</em>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRegarding [your commit](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/commit/e0ff057211c4569b0fafd77303ee360c5b25f0e7), this rule is already presents [here](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/e0ff057211c4569b0fafd77303ee360c5b25f0e7/FrenchFilter/sections/antiadblock.txt#L568) in fact.\r\n#### :arrow_right_hook: Have you noticed a

…</summary>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlthough with the same conditions used (and tested _before_ your commit) I can't seem to reproduce this on my end (i.e. I have no anti-adblock message and video is playing fine), I suspect one thing _(regarding these cases: use of AdGuard Home / AdGuard DNS / Firefox with ETP enabled)_:\r\n\r\nMy JS rule _(planned to be converted to scriptlet btw, now [this](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/e0ff057211c4569b0fafd77303ee360c5b25f0e7/FrenchFilter/sections/antiadblock.txt#L542) is fixed and most users have updated their AG installation)_ `tf1.fr#%#AG_defineProperty('__TF1_CONFIG__.adblock.serverRequest', { value: false, writable: false });` ¹ is _possibly_ sometimes not executed as quickly as required. Therefore, the request to `favicon.ico` is done and fails (because immediately blocked by the ETP protection regarding the Firefox case or because `0.0.0.0` returned for `static.adsafeprotected.com` for the DNS cases), consequently displaying an anti-adblock message.\r\n\r\n:arrow_right_hook: **Related / See also:** [uBlock Origin case](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues/14473) (which don't support _JS rules_).\r\n\r\n:arrow_right_hook: **Suggestion therefore:** Add `tf1.fr,tf1info.fr#%#//scriptlet('prevent-fetch', 'adsafeprotected')` ² just below [this line](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/e0ff057211c4569b0fafd77303ee360c5b25f0e7/FrenchFilter/sections/antiadblock.txt#L565). Thus, even in the case where the JS rule could not be applied quickly enough to signal the website not to make this request, it will be handled by this method.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n___\r\n###### ¹ Related to: `view-source:https://www.tf1.fr/` > `\"adblock\":{\"checkUrl\":\"https://static.adsafeprotected.com/favicon.ico\",\"display\":false,\"serverRequest\":true}`.\r\n\r\n###### ² They currently both use this URL, as can be seen by looking at: `__TF1_CONFIG__.adblock.checkUrl` (`tf1.fr`) and `__NEXT_DATA__.runtimeConfig.adBlock.serverUrl` (`tf1info.fr`) in console.\r\n</details>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1301915301/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-11-03T10:42:59Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
