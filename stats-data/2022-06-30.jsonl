I would like to affirm on something. When I didn't have AdGuard before, this websites forced me to click on pop ups ( random clicks on the pages then pop up show up) for two times. The same goes when i wanted to search something. Now, when I have AdGuard on,  it doesn't work no matter how many clicks I click on it, as if it's hung up or something.
