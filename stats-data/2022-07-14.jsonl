AdGuard прекрасно блокировал рекламу. Да, она там была всегда, но при включённом AdGuard не было никакой рекламы. И только после недавнего обновления приложения АйДаПрикол, даже при включенном AdGuard реклама через каждые 5-7 постов. Видимо, разработчики АйДаПрикола сумели обойти AdGuard. Надеюсь, это ненадолго )) Спасибо за ваше приложение в любом случае!\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/y5T8Zzs.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 9\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v3.6.8 (46)\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320), <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties (), <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent (), <br>Hide your IP address (209.141.53.254)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List, <br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental, <br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion, <br/>AdGuard DNS<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>ABPindo, <br/>Polish Anti-Annoying Special Supplement, <br/>List-KR, <br/>Hungarian, <br/>CJX's Annoyances List, <br/>EasyList Spanish, <br/>Thai Ads Filters, <br/>ROLIST2, <br/>road-block, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>KAD - Anti-Scam, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>Liste FR, <br/>Adblock List for Finland, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>Polish Annoyances Filters, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>xinggsf, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>YousList, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>Icelandic ABP List, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>EasyList Lithuania, <br/>EasyList Dutch, <br/>Bulgarian list, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters, <br/>Polish Social Filters, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>Estonian List, <br/>ROList, <br/>EasyList Hebrew, <br/>EasyList China, <br/>EasyList Germany, <br/>Polish GDPR-Cookies Filters, <br/>ChinaList+EasyList, <br/>Latvian List, <br/>ABPVN List, <br/>Iranian, <br/>Xfiles, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>RU AdList: Counters, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>EasyList Polish, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter, <br/>AlleBlock, <br/>Greek AdBlock Filter</details>\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Нет","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/124069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/124069/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-07-14T12:42:47Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
