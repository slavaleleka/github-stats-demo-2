С ним аудиорекалымы нет.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/LI0fKj0.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.11.1\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Block Flash\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>EasyList Thailand\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1308242404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-11-09T05:46:12Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

The page is just weird. Is it possible to block more redundant JavaScript? It would be ideal if the entire page just loads without waiting for scrolling section by section. This is probably for engagement analytics. \r\n> \r\n>  Also, if you catch occasional splash screen pop ups, please block those too.
