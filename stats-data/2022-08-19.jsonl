Let's have another go at it.\r\n> \r\n> Issue with ALL and ANY article at mmafighting.com. Every article begin with a headline. Below the headline there's an image or video related to the article. Below that there's the actual article/text. Below this there are usually another embedded video or sometimes just the comment section. In my included screen shot you'll see there a big white space sitting between the headline and the article, where the image or embedded video should be.  This is my issue. These images or youtube-videos only load with Adguard completely off. It doesn't matter which browser I use. I don't have this issue on any other site. I've had this issue on every computer I've had Adguard on.\r\n> \r\n> I did intentionally not provide a screen shot with Adguard off because I simply don't have the time to clean up the mess it would cause, but like I said, pick whichever article you like and you'll see for yourself. Needless to say I have tried many differens settings and filters through out the years but nothing seem to fix it.

Let's have another go at it.\r\n> \r\n> Issue with ALL and ANY article at mmafighting.com. Every article begin with a headline. Below the headline there's an image or video related to the article. Below that there's the actual article/text. Below this there are usually another embedded video or sometimes just the comment section. In my included screen shot you'll see there a big white space sitting between the headline and the article, where the image or embedded video should be.  This is my issue. These images or youtube-videos only load with Adguard completely off. It doesn't matter which browser I use. I don't have this issue on any other site. I've had this issue on every computer I've had Adguard on.\r\n> \r\n> I did intentionally not provide a screen shot with Adguard off because I simply don't have the time to clean up the mess it would cause, but like I said, pick whichever article you like and you'll see for yourself.

Let's have another go at it.\r\n> \r\n> Issue with ALL and ANY article at mmafighting.com. Every article begin with a headline. Below the headline there's an image or video related to the article. Below that there's the actual article/text. Below this there are usually another embedded video or sometimes just the comment section. In my included screen shot you'll see there a big white space sitting between the headline and the article, where the image or embedded video should be.  This is my issue. These images or youtube-videos only load with Adguard completely off. It doesn't matter which browser I use. I don't have this issue on any other site. I've had this issue on every computer I've had Adguard on.\r\n> \r\n> I did intentionally not provide a screen shot with Adguard off because I simply don't have the time to clean up the mess it would cause, but like I said, pick whichever article you like and you'll see for yourself. Needless to say I have tried many differens settings and filters through out the years but nothing seem to fix it. If a quit or pause Adguard (reload site and accept all cookies) It solves the issue for a couple of days, until these cookies needs to be renewed.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/Dhtwr6a.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/Dhtwr6a.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.8.1.1147+release\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (0), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Java, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties (), <br>Hide your User-Agent ()\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/mac_v2/filters/15.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Adblock List for Finland, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters</details>\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard+Popup+Blocker+(url:+https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js),<br>AdGuard+Assistant+(url:+https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js),<br>AdGuard+Extra+(url:+https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/127573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/127573/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-08-19T08:41:22Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Hello, I'm a Korean.\r\n> First, as I am not good at English I hope you understand well.\r\n> I have a trivial problem in mobile Edge inside Secure Folder, which is supported by Samsung Electronics.\r\n> I recently found the folder very useful.\r\n> But although I already had installed Adguard in my cell phone, all apps inside the folder showed me ads.\r\n> I found I need to install Adguard there again.\r\n> I logged in and registered the license.\r\n> And then, most apps didn't show me ads there.\r\n> But some websites still did in mobile Edge and Chrome, despite Adguard.\r\n> I attached a screenshot in the previous step.\r\n> What I wanna say is the websites didn't show me ads outside the folder, but if inside the folder, they still did.\r\n> I don't know my words made you understand.\r\n> I'm looking forward to your replies.\r\n> Have a good day!\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot
