Comment\r\nUsername: @twopir\r\n> Per comment in #123171, I have tried disabling and reenabling AdGuard, have uninstalled and reinstalled it, and have done filter updates, but this issue persists. No ads are being blocked. The product is completely nonfunctional.\r\n> \r\n> As you cannot reproduce the issue, is there any way to completely reset AdGuard and start from an empty configuration?\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/59Ofh97.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.4\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/123324/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/123324/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1178710787","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/123324#issuecomment-1178710787","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/123324","id":1178710787,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85GQbMD","user":{"login":"adguard-bot","id":30082422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDgyNDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30082422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/adguard-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-08T08:32:45Z","updated_at":"2022-07-08T08:32:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n### Issue URL (Annoyance)\r\n [https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/jul/07/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-lavrov-to-attend-g20-meeting-russian-troops-push-towards-sloviansk](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2Flive%2F2022%2Fjul%2F07%2Frussia-ukraine-war-live-news-lavrov-to-attend-g20-meeting-russian-troops-push-towards-sloviansk)\r\n### Comment\r\nUsername: @jslawler\r\n> \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/Jqys3Ew.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard/AdGuard Pro for iOS v4.4.0\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1178710787/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-07-08T08:32:45Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

[remove](https://kb.adguard.com/en/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters#pseudo-class-remove-and-pseudo-property-remove) in this case, as they give up displaying ad and let the tabs work normally if they can't find `.full_screen_ad`. I'll fix.\r\n(BTW `.full_screen_ad` is the top parent and all other `div[class^=\"full_screen_ad\"]` are descendants, meaning `##.full_screen_ad` is enough.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1178964968/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-07-08T13:02:31Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
