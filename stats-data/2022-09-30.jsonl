Comment\r\nUsername: @Taygahn\r\n> When Adguard is running, some elements on twitch won't load. In fact most features of the website are completely broken: the main page of twitch is broken, the video itself doesn't load, no recommended channels and no channel info. Chat works partially, messages load but not user badges. This only happens when Adguard is active, no other extensions or antivirus running, besides Windows's one. When protection is turned off everything works normally, deactivating filters however doesn't help.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/CcV48wp.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/r62HeEF.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.11+Beta+2\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Flash, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties (www.twitch.tv), <br>Hide your User-Agent ()\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://security.cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `User+rules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/beta/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/beta/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1263070842/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-09-30T03:51:55Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Please read carefully as this was reported but only resulted in the example domain used to illustrate getting whitelisted, and this is affecting thousands of domains, causing the sites to appear broken, with more added every day - we are a service provider with a form builder used on customer sites, all users of these forms are affected. Forms provided by Constant Contact's SharpSpring do not display on sites using them when AdGuard's tracking protection is enabled. The script to display forms is separate from the service's tracking script, and should be allowed to generate the form.\r\n2. The tracking script in ss.js creates a cookie and allows for tracking. The script in form.js generates the form, but will not track if ss.js was blocked from running and creating the cookie, as it relies on that for tracking. The form will still submit info without the tracking cookie and behave normally otherwise.\r\n3. Note that the subdomain for the script is slightly different for each customer. In the sshtml.org example below, the tracking script is loaded via https://koi-3QNDUN6A20.marketingautomation.services/client/ss.js?ver=2.4.0\r\nAnd the form script is loaded via https://koi-3qnegvsspc.marketingautomation.services/client/form.js?ver=2.0.1\r\nThe subdomain beginning with 'koi' will be different for each domain and customer. The version numbers at the end, after the ? in the URL, may be different as well, depending on when the form was implemented.\r\nUltimately, if `*` is considered a wildcard, blocking `*marketingautomation.services*ss.js*` would be appropriate, as an example, while allowing form.js which is currently being blocked.\r\n4. The rules that EasyList use properly block tracking, but not the forms when used with AdBlock Plus for example.\r\nSee the EasyList tracking blocking rules here, and look for the domain 'marketingautomation.services' (it can take up to 5 minutes or more to fully load the page):\r\nhttps://easylist.to/easylist/easyprivacy.txt\r\n5. If you want to block tracking, blocking ss.js will do that. The form.js will work as a form, but not track, if ss.js has not generated the cookie. \r\n\r\n6.

Please read carefully as this was reported but only resulted in the example domain used to illustrate getting whitelisted, and this is affecting thousands of domains, causing the sites to appear broken, with more added every day - we are a service provider with a form builder used on customer sites, all users of these forms are affected. Forms provided by Constant Contact's SharpSpring do not display on sites using them when AdGuard's tracking protection is enabled. The script to display forms is separate from the service's tracking script, and should be allowed to generate the form.\r\n2. The tracking script in ss.js creates a cookie and allows for tracking. The script in form.js generates the form, but will not track if ss.js was blocked from running and creating the cookie, as it relies on that for tracking. The form will still submit info without the tracking cookie and behave normally otherwise.\r\n3. Note that the subdomain for the script is slightly different for each customer. In the sshtml.org example below, the tracking script is loaded via https://koi-3QNDUN6A20.marketingautomation.services/client/ss.js?ver=2.4.0\r\nAnd the form script is loaded via https://koi-3qnegvsspc.marketingautomation.services/client/form.js?ver=2.0.1\r\nThe subdomain beginning with 'koi' will be different for each domain and customer. The version numbers at the end, after the ? in the URL, may be different as well, depending on when the form was implemented.\r\nUltimately, if `*` is considered a wildcard, blocking `*marketingautomation.services*ss.js*` would be appropriate, as an example, while allowing form.js which is currently being blocked.\r\n4. The rules that EasyList use properly block tracking, but not the forms when used with AdBlock Plus for example.\r\nSee the EasyList tracking blocking rules here, and look for the domain 'marketingautomation.services' (it can take up to 5 minutes or more to fully load the page):\r\nhttps://easylist.to/easylist/easyprivacy.txt\r\n5. If you want to block tracking, blocking ss.js will do that. The form.js will work as a form, but not track, if ss.js has not generated the cookie. \r\n\r\n6.
