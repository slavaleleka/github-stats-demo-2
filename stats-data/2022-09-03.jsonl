the app , it does not let me set the wallpaper because of the ad as the app stuck at the message \" you can set the wallpaper right after the \"video\" ad\" but the ad never comes because of the adguard      and I am never able to set the wallpaper.   \r\n> \r\n> It would be great if you could bypass this message of \" set the wallpaper after this video ad\" on this app and help  me download
