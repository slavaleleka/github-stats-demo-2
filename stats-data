Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [http://mesg.benl.ebay.be](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmesg.benl.ebay.be)\r\n### Comment\r\n> The public AdGuard DNS server(s) 94.140.14.14 and 94.140.15.15 have trouble resolving the domain \"mesg.benl.ebay.be\" from time to time, especially in the last few days. This is used for messaging on the Belgium Ebay site, and should not be blocked or remain unresolved in DNS. In the screenshot you can see that DNS resolving works OK one second, but the next second it doesn't anymore without any changes to the system. When I test DNS resolution on Quad9's (9.9.9.9) DNS server it works there while at the same time it doesn't work on AdGuard Public DNS. I have also seen this behaviour on other subdomains from domain \"ebay.be\" and even on the main site as well.\r\n> This is not related to any browser or other software as the DNS requests are directly done from the client to AdGaurd's DNS servers. There is no DNS blocking or blocking software in place.\r\n> Could you investigate why this is the case, as it does not look like expected behaviour?\r\n> \r\n> Thank you\r\n\r\n###

Comment\r\nUsername: @Frescootje\r\n> So far webpower.eu is the only website with problems. The strange thing is, the issue also occurs with AdGuard disabled. If I shutdown AdGuard it's working fine, though.\r\n> The newsletter from anwb.nl is using webpower.eu when you click on a link. Through webpower.eu you should reach the actual anwb.nl page, in the end. Also, omroepmax.nl is using webpower.eu when clicking on a newsletter link, and is giving me the same issue.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/9Nli91f.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/5w8PifF.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.8.1.1140 release\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `sdns://AgAAAAAAAAAAAAAaZmQ2MzE1ZWYuZC5hZGd1YXJkLWRucy5jb20KL2Rucy1xdWVyeQ`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/mac_v2/filters/15.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Dutch\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)\r\nOther extensions used: | none","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/122208/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/122208/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1161639750","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/122208#issuecomment-1161639750","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/122208","id":1161639750,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85FPTdG","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-21T11:48:03Z","updated_at":"2022-06-21T11:48:03Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi.webpower.eu was blocked as ad server.\r\nI cannot open yur link.
