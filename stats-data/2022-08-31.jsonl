Помогите пожалуйста решить проблему конфликтов фильтра AdGuard Russian FIlter.\r\n> Мы уже неоднократно замечали, что это правило ломает плеер в определенных случаях:\r\n> \r\n> /:\\/\\/([a-z-]{6}\\.)?(?!aniqit)[a-z0-9]{4,}\\.(com|in\\.net|link|tech|ru)/$xmlhttprequest,domain=aniqit.com|kodik.info|start.u-cdn.top|ustore.bz|u-stream.in\r\n> \r\n> В этоп правиле домены плеера это только aniqit.com и kodik.info. Остальные это уже другие плееры и не знаю почему они все в одном правиле.\r\n> \r\n> Суть в том, что при определенном стечении обстоятельств (возможно это зависит от конкретного поддомена CDN, который отдается при скачивании видео) блокировщик рекламы блокирует не только рекламу, но и само видео.\r\n> \r\n> Вообще данное правило лично для меня выглядит очень сложным и я не до конца понимаю как оно рабоатет, но мне кажется именно домены aniqit.com и kodik.info можно из него спокойно убрать, так как вся реклама в плеере Kodik блокируется множеством других правил. А конкретно это правило я видел только в случаях, когда пользователи жаловались на то, что у них не работает плеер (и у самого также случались такие проблемы).\r\n> \r\n> Буду очень благодарен, если вы можете решить данную проблему.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/9y5AJzy.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/fzQQIQt.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/07hZryj.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | uBlock Origin AdGuard Russian Filter\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nFilters: | <b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/128521/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/128521/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-08-31T13:33:10Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Lately in the latest AdGuard updates, after rolling over some Tweets, Twitter login popup is showing up, pretty annoying. I don't know, maybe 1 or 2 months ago.\r\n> \r\n> I didn't change anything, those are my configurations since I installed AdGuard.\r\n> \r\n> Hope you can fix this. Thank you!\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/WPq0wGU.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.22\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (2880), <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>EasyList Cookie List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1233240376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-08-31T17:51:12Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Вот уже несколько дней как возникли проблемы с отображением фотографий в социальной сети \"В контакте\". Фотографии отображаются не все, так же возникла проблема с отображением видео.  Мне показалось, что одной из причин может быть блокировщик рекламы. Решила просто включить и выключить его, как бы перезагрузить, но в результате у меня тупо блокируется весь \"В контакте\". Не только моя страница, но и лента новостей. Пользоваться сайтом решительно невозможно. Появился тупо серый экран. При выключении приложения эта проблема уходит, но возникает реклама. Что в данном случае возможно предпринять для восстановления корректной работы приложения?\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/rQDkQBY.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/Tsi7CQN.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.22\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter\r\nOther extensions used: | антивирус ESET","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1233335799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-08-31T19:27:09Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
