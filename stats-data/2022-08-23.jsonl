I am replying to you using a translator, the attached address is the VOD address of the live streaming site in Korea. (The main address is https://www.afreecatv.com) I deleted the video number after the address and asked, so I don't think you can play it with that address. If you are not a Korean, you can use a translator and enter VOD replay?, and the phenomenon I inquired about usually occurs once an hour while watching VOD, and infinite loading occurs for 5 to 10 minutes. If you want to check the problem, it will take a lot of time, so we will wait for Koreans to solve the problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1224150269/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-08-23T14:23:44Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
