rare\r\n- `(?:[a-z0-9]{2}\\/)` repeated only two times is rare\r\n\r\nAlso the original regex put in specific.txt seems to be only historical reason, they are generic pattern so moved to

rare\r\n- `(?:[a-z0-9]{2}\\/)` repeated only two times is rare\r\n\r\nAlso the original regex put in specific.txt seems to be only historical reason, they are generic pattern so moved to

Your comment\r\n\r\nI don't know whether `(?:www\\.)?` works on CB so didn't add. Tell me if it works. I concentrated on covering as much targets by as simple regex as possible.\r\n\r\n- Almost 100% of them now use .com domain\r\n- There are certainly cases starting from www or pl******* but rather rare\r\n- `(?:[a-z0-9]{2}\\/)` repeated only two times is rare\r\n\r\nAlso the original regex put in specific.txt seems to be only historical reason, they are generic pattern so moved to

rare\r\n- `(?:[a-z0-9]{2}\\/)` repeated only two times is rare\r\n\r\nAlso the original regex put in specific.txt seems to be only historical reason, they are generic pattern so moved to

It reports 7 filters, 123651 rules, 20642 advanced rules, and a last update of August 3, 2022 at 1:03 AM (UTC), but every web page I visit is drenched in ads. Turning it on and off has not worked. Updating filters has not worked. Uninstalling and reinstalling has not worked.

twitter.\r\n> \r\n> Il manque un bouton rapide sur le popup de l'extension pour dÃ©sactiver le blocage des nuisances uniquement pour certains sites, tout en bloquant les trackers.\r\n> \r\n> Actuellement, il faut retourner dans les rÃ©glages, dÃ©sactiver, recharger la page, accepter les cookies, puis retourner dans les rÃ©glages pour activer les filtres pour enfin recharger la page.\r\n> \r\n> C'est insupportable, problÃ¨me qui ne se pose pas avec ublock qui permet de dÃ©sactiver les filtres esthÃ©tiques, et qui m'empÃªche de recommander Adguard Ã  des nÃ©ophytes en informatique.\r\n>
