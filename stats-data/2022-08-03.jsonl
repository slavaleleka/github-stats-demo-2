rare\r\n- `(?:[a-z0-9]{2}\\/)` repeated only two times is rare\r\n\r\nAlso the original regex put in specific.txt seems to be only historical reason, they are generic pattern so moved to

rare\r\n- `(?:[a-z0-9]{2}\\/)` repeated only two times is rare\r\n\r\nAlso the original regex put in specific.txt seems to be only historical reason, they are generic pattern so moved to
