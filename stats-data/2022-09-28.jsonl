seems that it's caused by this

rules.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n>The filter works with uBlock Origin\r\n\r\nIn this case, it rather looks like that this rule doesn't work with uBlock Origin.\r\nIf I'm not wrong, uBlock Origin doesn't apply element hiding/CSS rules if \"website\" is just an image, but AdGuard does, hence the difference.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n@yourduskquibbles Could you please take a

However, the ad here is still hidden by AdGuard, but the vote options isn't  enabled, however long we might wait.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/qzthW5t.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/Yo86Qxr.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.36\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard French, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130900/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130900/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1260687304","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130900#issuecomment-1260687304","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130900","id":1260687304,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85LJI_I","user":{"login":"AdamWr","id":29142494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQyNDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29142494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamWr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-28T10:11:02Z","updated_at":"2022-09-28T10:11:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I cannot reproduce it.\r\nAd is skipped and vote button is clickable after a very short while.\r\n<details><summary>Screenshot</summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29142494/192752741-87cb9820-14a0-48dd-9896-1ca60e1fe9fd.png)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nPlease disable filter lists one by one and check which one causes this issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1260687304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-09-28T10:11:02Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\nUsername: @PsychoFox11\r\n> The tracking filter is blocking forms provided from SharpSpring by Constant Contact, on Windows. Edge was listed but it occurs in Chrome etc. as well. The example is on their own page, but affects forms of all customers using Constant Contact's SharpSpring product as well, in turn affecting a large number of sites.\r\n> If the intention is to block tracking, it should block ss.js but but not form.js - however it seems to block both currently.\r\n> The rules that EasyList use properly block tracking, but not the forms.\r\n> See the EasyList tracking blocking rules here, and look for the domain 'marketingautomation.services':\r\n> https://easylist.to/easylist/easyprivacy.txt\r\n> As this is affecting the sits of many Constant Contact customers using this product, it would be very helpful if the forms were not blocked along with the tracking. The form.js script cannot track if the cookie was not generated by ss.js, so blocking only ss.js should prevent the tracking while allowing forms.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/DdPeWKT.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/v67dKAr.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.10.2 (build 3961, CL 1.9.86)\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection\r\nUserscripts: | Default install - Just AdGuard Plus and AdGuard Popup blocker","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130852/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-09-28T12:33:05Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

At the same time, there're lots of great people that supply pull requests and help maintain the repo.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThe solution to our problems consists of several steps.\r\n\r\n### 1. Help people contribute, write the repository documentation.\r\n\r\nThe first step is to write the \"CONTRIBUTING.md\" document that should explain how to properly contribute to AdGuard filters. The contents of that document can be discussed in the comments, but here's how I see it:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Contributing to AdGuard filters\r\n\r\nShort introduction, explain what the ways to contribute are.\r\n\r\n## How to work with this repo\r\n\r\n1. Install Visual Studio Code with the \"Adblock\" syntax plugin (we need links)\r\n2. Clone (or fork and clone) this repo (a link to git tutorial is appropriate here)\r\n3. Make your changes and commit them.\r\n4. Every commit needs to be linked to an issue. The commit message should look like (`fixes #123` where `123` is the issue number). This way the issue will be closed automatically once this commit lands in the `master` branch.\r\n\r\n## How to write filter rules\r\n\r\nHere should be a link to the official documentation.\r\n\r\nWe should also explain the quality requirements (might need to update them as well):\r\nhttps://kb.adguard.com/en/general/adguard-filter-policy#quality-requirements-for-filtering-rules\r\n\r\nFilters policy link is also appropriate here (check if it needs to be updated as well).\r\n\r\n## Repository structure\r\n\r\nAdGuard filters are combined from the files in this repository. This is an automated process that is done periodically by the scripts in the [FiltersRegistry](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/FiltersRegistry) repo. In this repository, every filter list is split into a number of files and every file has its own purpose. If you're adding a new rule, make sure it is added to the proper file.\r\n\r\n#### AdGuard Base filter\r\n\r\n* Purpose: explain the purpose\r\n* [Base folder](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/tree/master/EnglishFilter/sections)\r\n* Requirements for rule submissions: blah blah blah\r\n* Notes: AdGuard Base filter is supposed to be used alongside [Easylist](https://github.com/easylist/easylist) so there's no need to add rules which are already in the Easylist.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a part of this task, we should update the header of every file. Let me give one example of that.\r\n\r\n* [adservers.txt](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/EnglishFilter/sections/adservers.txt) current explanation is `Section contains list of advertising networks`. It does not explain much, tbh. Here's what we should put there:\r\n\r\n```\r\n!\r\n! This section contains the list of third-party advertising networks domains. Note, that we only put\r\n! rules that block full domains here and not URL parts (there's `general_url.txt` for that). Also, it must\r\n! be domains that are used in a third-party context.\r\n!\r\n! Good: ||doubleclick.net^$third-party\r\n! Bad: /banner.jpg (should be in general_url.txt)\r\n! Bad: ||adssubdomain.legitwebsite.com^ (should be in adservers_firstparty.txt)\r\n!\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Pull request template\r\n\r\nCreate a pull request template as explained [here](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository). Check if we can use [Github form schema](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-githubs-form-schema) in the template.\r\n\r\nThis template should explain the following:\r\n\r\n1. Requirements for rules suggestion (link the contribution doc).\r\n2. Consider adding a requirement of adding a screenshot that will ease the pull request verification. For instance, for cosmetic rules, there should be a screenshot that shows both the blocked element AND the HTML code.\r\n3. Explain that we verify every pull request manually so it may take time to apply it.\r\n\r\n### 3. Configure stale bot for the repo\r\n\r\n1. I suggest using really strict rules that will close issues as stale if there's no activity for one week.\r\n2. The stale bot message should explain that we might have no time to process reports for websites that are not popular (no activity for a week signals that there are not too many concerned users). Explain that there's an alternative, the user may want to submit a pull request instead.\r\n3. Do not forget to specify what labels should be excluded.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n* [x] CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n* [x] Pull request template\r\n* [x] Stale bot configuration\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/107129/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/107129/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-09-28T15:03:24Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\nUsername: @PsychoFox11\r\n> The tracking filter is blocking forms provided from SharpSpring by Constant Contact, on Windows. Edge was listed but it occurs in Chrome etc. as well. The example is on their own page, but affects forms of all customers using Constant Contact's SharpSpring product as well, in turn affecting a large number of sites.\r\n> If the intention is to block tracking, it should block ss.js but but not form.js - however it seems to block both currently.\r\n> The rules that EasyList use properly block tracking, but not the forms.\r\n> See the EasyList tracking blocking rules here, and look for the domain 'marketingautomation.services':\r\n> https://easylist.to/easylist/easyprivacy.txt\r\n> As this is affecting the sits of many Constant Contact customers using this product, it would be very helpful if the forms were not blocked along with the tracking. The form.js script cannot track if the cookie was not generated by ss.js, so blocking only ss.js should prevent the tracking while allowing forms.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/DdPeWKT.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/v67dKAr.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.10.2 (build 3961, CL 1.9.86)\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection\r\nUserscripts: | Default install - Just AdGuard Plus and AdGuard Popup blocker","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130852/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1261194813","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130852#issuecomment-1261194813","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130852","id":1261194813,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85LLE49","user":{"login":"PsychoFox11","id":5882157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODIxNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5882157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PsychoFox11","html_url":"https://github.com/PsychoFox11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PsychoFox11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PsychoFox11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PsychoFox11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PsychoFox11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PsychoFox11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PsychoFox11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PsychoFox11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PsychoFox11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PsychoFox11/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-28T16:54:43Z","updated_at":"2022-09-28T16:54:43Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jellizaveta This does not only affect sharpspring.com but all sites using forms provided by Constant Contact's SharpSpring product, as noted in the description.
