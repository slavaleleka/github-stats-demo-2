seems that it's caused by this

rules.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n>The filter works with uBlock Origin\r\n\r\nIn this case, it rather looks like that this rule doesn't work with uBlock Origin.\r\nIf I'm not wrong, uBlock Origin doesn't apply element hiding/CSS rules if \"website\" is just an image, but AdGuard does, hence the difference.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n@yourduskquibbles Could you please take a

to vote for a bot, while top.gg initially displays an ad before allowing to vote, having AdGuard on usually prevents from waiting and allows to directly vote. However, the ad here is still hidden by AdGuard, but the vote options isn't  enabled, however long we might wait.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/qzthW5t.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/Yo86Qxr.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.36\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard French, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130900/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130900/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1260687304","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130900#issuecomment-1260687304","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130900","id":1260687304,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85LJI_I","user":{"login":"AdamWr","id":29142494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQyNDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29142494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamWr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-28T10:11:02Z","updated_at":"2022-09-28T10:11:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I cannot reproduce it.\r\nAd is skipped and vote button is clickable after a very short while.\r\n<details><summary>Screenshot</summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29142494/192752741-87cb9820-14a0-48dd-9896-1ca60e1fe9fd.png)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nPlease disable filter lists one by one and check which one causes this issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1260687304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-09-28T10:11:02Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\nUsername: @PsychoFox11\r\n> The tracking filter is blocking forms provided from SharpSpring by Constant Contact, on Windows. Edge was listed but it occurs in Chrome etc. as well. The example is on their own page, but affects forms of all customers using Constant Contact's SharpSpring product as well, in turn affecting a large number of sites.\r\n> If the intention is to block tracking, it should block ss.js but but not form.js - however it seems to block both currently.\r\n> The rules that EasyList use properly block tracking, but not the forms.\r\n> See the EasyList tracking blocking rules here, and look for the domain 'marketingautomation.services':\r\n> https://easylist.to/easylist/easyprivacy.txt\r\n> As this is affecting the sits of many Constant Contact customers using this product, it would be very helpful if the forms were not blocked along with the tracking. The form.js script cannot track if the cookie was not generated by ss.js, so blocking only ss.js should prevent the tracking while allowing forms.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/DdPeWKT.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/v67dKAr.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.10.2 (build 3961, CL 1.9.86)\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection\r\nUserscripts: | Default install - Just AdGuard Plus and AdGuard Popup blocker","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130852/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-09-28T12:33:05Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
