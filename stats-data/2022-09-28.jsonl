seems that it's caused by this

rules.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n>The filter works with uBlock Origin\r\n\r\nIn this case, it rather looks like that this rule doesn't work with uBlock Origin.\r\nIf I'm not wrong, uBlock Origin doesn't apply element hiding/CSS rules if \"website\" is just an image, but AdGuard does, hence the difference.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n@yourduskquibbles Could you please take a

to vote for a bot, while top.gg initially displays an ad before allowing to vote, having AdGuard on usually prevents from waiting and allows to directly vote. However, the ad here is still hidden by AdGuard, but the vote options isn't  enabled, however long we might wait.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/qzthW5t.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/Yo86Qxr.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.36\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard French, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130900/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130900/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1260687304","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130900#issuecomment-1260687304","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130900","id":1260687304,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85LJI_I","user":{"login":"AdamWr","id":29142494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQyNDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29142494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamWr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-28T10:11:02Z","updated_at":"2022-09-28T10:11:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I cannot reproduce it.\r\nAd is skipped and vote button is clickable after a very short while.\r\n<details><summary>Screenshot</summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29142494/192752741-87cb9820-14a0-48dd-9896-1ca60e1fe9fd.png)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nPlease disable filter lists one by one and check which one causes this issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1260687304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-09-28T10:11:02Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
