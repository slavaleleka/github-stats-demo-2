rare\r\n- `(?:[a-z0-9]{2}\\/)` repeated only two times is rare\r\n\r\nAlso the original regex put in specific.txt seems to be only historical reason, they are generic pattern so moved to

rare\r\n- `(?:[a-z0-9]{2}\\/)` repeated only two times is rare\r\n\r\nAlso the original regex put in specific.txt seems to be only historical reason, they are generic pattern so moved to

Your comment\r\n\r\nI don't know whether `(?:www\\.)?` works on CB so didn't add. Tell me if it works. I concentrated on covering as much targets by as simple regex as possible.\r\n\r\n- Almost 100% of them now use .com domain\r\n- There are certainly cases starting from www or pl******* but rather rare\r\n- `(?:[a-z0-9]{2}\\/)` repeated only two times is rare\r\n\r\nAlso the original regex put in specific.txt seems to be only historical reason, they are generic pattern so moved to
