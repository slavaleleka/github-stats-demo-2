Наклацала непонятно что, вроде вернула все обратно, но теперь вылезла проблема - законные две рекламы вернулись к моим просмотрам сериалов и фильмов. При этом на самом сайте много всплывающих окон и баннеров, их по прежнему не видно. Что я наклацала не знаю, в самом сафари расширение включено, с настроек все включено, если в приложение зайти то там стоит защита сафари включена. А по факту лажа.
