When started, app does not show ads. Start the timer, yet no ads appear. After the counter hits zero, the alarm sounds. To stop the alarm, you press the stop button. One or two seconds later, an ad appears at the top. This behavior does not change with your method. This app, timer alarm, seems to get ads when a user presses the stop button. Thank you.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/KorRMNj.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/5MjfeJN.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/453QeMC.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard/AdGuard Pro for iOS v4.4.4\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Not Know`<br>filters: `AdGuard`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Japanese\r\nOther extensions used: | https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/id1067755201","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1285589359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-10-20T13:56:13Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
