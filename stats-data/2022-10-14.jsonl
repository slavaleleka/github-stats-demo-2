Translate：\r\n”In the middle of the screenshot of the webpage, the \"chosen moment\" cannot be clicked, and then you can see that there is a transparent black background frame. Another screenshot is this \"chosen moment\" framing code I viewed with my browser. There is no way to take a screenshot of closing ADG, because after refreshing this, it will be gone. In fact, it is very simple. When ADG is not turned on, the frame does not have a transparent black background frame at the bottom, and then it can be clicked normally.“\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1278319963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-10-14T00:29:41Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

AdGuard is set - MSN ads appear when using ad block, or when turning it off for the site.   Previously I was able to block elements from the old adguard link that was available in the sub-menu.  when trying to block ads from the new adguard extension that appears in the address bar, there is no way to select the element to block, either from the rotating ads at the top of the page, or from the banner in the middle of the page.   i have been dealing with this for over a month and i cannot get any assistance from you guys whatsoever.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/bAkRzDB.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard/AdGuard Pro for iOS v4.4.4\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `adguard`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/131852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/131852/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-10-14T16:24:21Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

AdGuard is set - MSN ads appear when using ad block, or when turning it off for the site.   Previously I was able to block elements from the old adguard link that was available in the sub-menu.  when trying to block ads from the new adguard extension that appears in the address bar, there is no way to select the element to block, either from the rotating ads at the top of the page, or from the banner in the middle of the page.   i have been dealing with this for over a month and i cannot get any assistance from you guys whatsoever.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/bAkRzDB.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard/AdGuard Pro for iOS v4.4.4\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `adguard`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/131852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/131852/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1279354126","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/131852#issuecomment-1279354126","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/131852","id":1279354126,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85MQWUO","user":{"login":"mshea77","id":115499443,"node_id":"U_kgDOBuJhsw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115499443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshea77","html_url":"https://github.com/mshea77","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshea77/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshea77/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshea77/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshea77/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshea77/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshea77/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshea77/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshea77/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mshea77/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-14T18:56:56Z","updated_at":"2022-10-14T18:56:56Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"and as i reported earlier - i have searched my adguard app on every ipad i own - can’t find any annoyance filters anywhere - i believe it said something about “coming to ios” but apparently not there yet\n\n> On Oct 14, 2022, at 2:32 PM, BlazDT ***@***.***> wrote:\n> \n> \n> Shopping section is removed with the rules I added previously (can take a while until available).

Issue URL (Ads)\r\n [http://msn.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmsn.com)\r\n### Comment\r\nUsername: @mshea77\r\n> Ads remain regardless of how AdGuard is set - MSN ads appear when using ad block, or when turning it off for the site.   Previously I was able to block elements from the old adguard link that was available in the sub-menu.  when trying to block ads from the new adguard extension that appears in the address bar, there is no way to select the element to block, either from the rotating ads at the top of the page, or from the banner in the middle of the page.   i have been dealing with this for over a month and i cannot get any assistance from you guys whatsoever.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/bAkRzDB.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard/AdGuard Pro for iOS v4.4.4\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `adguard`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/131852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/131852/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1279333616","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/131852#issuecomment-1279333616","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/131852","id":1279333616,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85MQRTw","user":{"login":"BlazDT","id":34266271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjY2Mjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34266271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT","html_url":"https://github.com/BlazDT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-14T18:32:25Z","updated_at":"2022-10-14T18:32:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Shopping section is removed with the rules I added previously (can take a while until available).
