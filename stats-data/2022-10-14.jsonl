Translate：\r\n”In the middle of the screenshot of the webpage, the \"chosen moment\" cannot be clicked, and then you can see that there is a transparent black background frame. Another screenshot is this \"chosen moment\" framing code I viewed with my browser. There is no way to take a screenshot of closing ADG, because after refreshing this, it will be gone. In fact, it is very simple. When ADG is not turned on, the frame does not have a transparent black background frame at the bottom, and then it can be clicked normally.“\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1278319963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-10-14T00:29:41Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
