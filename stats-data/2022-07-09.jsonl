Your comment_**\r\n\r\nHi. First of all, sorry for the delay.\r\n\r\nIn short, these two issues can _probably_ be explained either by a glitch (see in particular the fact that two instances of AdGuard are used simultaneously on one of the two issues, both of which seem to me to come from the same person by the way) or by the fact that some premium content (coming from their partnership with _6play_ here) would _potentially_ not use `.featPlayerAds`. Although that doesn't seem to be the case.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the current solution, although never faulty in my tests, is a bit fragile on a glitch level because it must be correctly defined once the DOM of the page is loaded _(document)_ but before its use ~ 2 sec. later in `main.[…].js` _(script)_.\r\n\r\nTherefore, for the possible rare case where my `set-constant` line wouldn't react fast enough, added:\r\n- its `$document,replace=[…]` version (for AG products supporting it);\r\n- a deletion of the following JSON content via the `json-prune` scriptlet, where `*` is any ad provider name:\r\n  - `ads.*.default` _[binary]_ (to allow to never see [that](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4764956/141113868-85bdb3d1-1f24-4ac2-ac20-0000afc560b9.png) in this situation too — English translation: \"Advertising: Your content is loading\");\r\n  - `ads.*.url` _[string]_ (to prevent contacting any ad provider, currently two present, now or later; with `ads.enableAntiAdBlocking` removed alongside);\r\n  - `ads.enableMidrolls` _[binary]_ (to prevent any possible/future 'OSD' visual stuff showing before trying to show them).\r\n\r\nThe final `, 'ads'` _(another parameter)_ being for optimization purposes: if I understand it correctly, this will allow in this case for each \"JSON data\" where the `[ROOT].ads` property is absent, to only look for its presence once instead of 3 times.\r\n\r\n**_2.
