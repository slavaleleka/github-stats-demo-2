На втором скриншоте после ввода логина и пароля иногда появляется captcha, где нужно провести бегунком слева-направо. Не знаю, при каких обстоятельствах появляется эта captcha, но теперь у меня она не появляется, потому что я авторизовался с выключенным AdGuard. Повторная авторизация не показывает «капчи». Сломана не сама форма авторизации, а captcha, после ввода которой процесс авторизации не завершается, окно с введёнными логином и паролем не исчезает, повторные вводы «капчи» не дают результата.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/kiReeP8.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/pdsBDw9.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.11\r\nBrowser: | Yandex\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Flash, <br>Block Java, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties (aliexpress.ru)\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>Legitimate URL Shortener, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133409/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-10-28T05:58:18Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Какой-то из последних фильтров ломает авторизацию на Aliexpress. На втором скриншоте после ввода логина и пароля иногда появляется captcha, где нужно провести бегунком слева-направо. Не знаю, при каких обстоятельствах появляется эта captcha, но теперь у меня она не появляется, потому что я авторизовался с выключенным AdGuard. Повторная авторизация не показывает «капчи». Сломана не сама форма авторизации, а captcha, после ввода которой процесс авторизации не завершается, окно с введёнными логином и паролем не исчезает, повторные вводы «капчи» не дают результата.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/kiReeP8.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/pdsBDw9.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.11\r\nBrowser: | Yandex\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Flash, <br>Block Java, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties (aliexpress.ru)\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>Legitimate URL Shortener, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133409/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1294819186","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133409#issuecomment-1294819186","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133409","id":1294819186,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85NLV9y","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-28T10:20:43Z","updated_at":"2022-10-28T10:20:43Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@lucelem У меня не повторилось - капча есть.

Какой-то из последних фильтров ломает авторизацию на Aliexpress. На втором скриншоте после ввода логина и пароля иногда появляется captcha, где нужно провести бегунком слева-направо. Не знаю, при каких обстоятельствах появляется эта captcha, но теперь у меня она не появляется, потому что я авторизовался с выключенным AdGuard. Повторная авторизация не показывает «капчи». Сломана не сама форма авторизации, а captcha, после ввода которой процесс авторизации не завершается, окно с введёнными логином и паролем не исчезает, повторные вводы «капчи» не дают результата.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/kiReeP8.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/pdsBDw9.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.11\r\nBrowser: | Yandex\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Flash, <br>Block Java, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties (aliexpress.ru)\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>Legitimate URL Shortener, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133409/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1294867757","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133409#issuecomment-1294867757","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133409","id":1294867757,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85NLh0t","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-28T11:12:25Z","updated_at":"2022-10-28T11:12:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"У меня капчи при входе не было, залогинился под своим аккаунтом без нее.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1294867757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-10-28T11:12:26Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\nUsername: @tox1c90\r\n> I think I understand now what the problem is that in some cases Bing ads are slipping through. Just noticed by chance that ALL of my search results are served as IMAGES/blobs instead of text. Only the headlines and URLs can be selected and copied as text, the actual preview of each result including the \"ad\" marker is contained in an image object, if you try to select the text with your mouse/cursor one actually drags the whole thing around.\r\n> This is not only the case for ads, but for all search results when Adguard is enabled.\r\n> \r\n> In inPrivate mode of the browser, this does not happen, and all search results are served as proper selectable text. And then, Adguard is able to block all ads.\r\n> \r\n> So the ads are obviously not missed by the filter, but it's Bing running some kind of Adblock detection, which switches the way search results are delivered from text mode to small inline images/snippets/blobs.\r\n> \r\n> Anything one can do to get around this? Better way of hiding Adguard?\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/RuaiVmm.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/tkZXG28.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/bgFJI5O.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.11\r\nBrowser: | Edge 106.0.1370.52 (Chromium-based)\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard German\r\nUserscripts: | https://greasyfork.org/scripts/5357-remove-google-results-redirect/code/Remove%20Google%20Results%20Redirect.user.js,<br>https://greasyfork.org/scripts/18450-steam-bypass-age-confirmation-prompts/code/Steam:%20Bypass%20age%20confirmation%20prompts.user.js,<br>https://greasyfork.org/scripts/383093-twitch-disable-automatic-video-downscale/code/Twitch%20-%20Disable%20automatic%20video%20downscale.user.js,<br>C:\\Users\\marti\\OneDrive\\Anwendungen\\Adguard\\Youtube%201440p.user.js,<br>https://nightdev.com/betterttv/other/betterttv.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-wot/1.0/wot.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://www.bing.com/search?q=fritz+dect+302&cvid=cf581884581c4bc88fd942687290bf5c&aqs=edge.1.69i60j69i59j0j69i57j69i59j0l2j69i60l2.1289j0j9&PC=U531&first=1&FORM=PERE](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bing.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dfritz%2Bdect%2B302%26cvid%3Dcf581884581c4bc88fd942687290bf5c%26aqs%3Dedge.1.69i60j69i59j0j69i57j69i59j0l2j69i60l2.1289j0j9%26PC%3DU531%26first%3D1%26FORM%3DPERE)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133445/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1294981295","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133445#issuecomment-1294981295","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133445","id":1294981295,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85NL9iv","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-28T13:09:32Z","updated_at":"2022-10-28T13:09:32Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@tox1c90 Hmm, I can't reroduce it with German VPN, ads are blocked.\r\nIf you have vitrual PC, is it possible to check remotely?

Какой-то из последних фильтров ломает авторизацию на Aliexpress. На втором скриншоте после ввода логина и пароля иногда появляется captcha, где нужно провести бегунком слева-направо. Не знаю, при каких обстоятельствах появляется эта captcha, но теперь у меня она не появляется, потому что я авторизовался с выключенным AdGuard. Повторная авторизация не показывает «капчи».

Just noticed by chance that ALL of my search results are served as IMAGES/blobs instead of text. Only the headlines and URLs can be selected and copied as text, the actual preview of each result including the \"ad\" marker is contained in an image object, if you try to select the text with your mouse/cursor one actually drags the whole thing around.\r\n> This is not only the case for ads, but for all search results when Adguard is enabled.\r\n> \r\n> In inPrivate mode of the browser, this does not happen, and all search results are served as proper selectable text. And then, Adguard is able to block all ads.\r\n> \r\n> So the ads are obviously not missed by the filter, but it's Bing running some kind of Adblock detection, which switches the way search results are delivered from text mode to small inline images/snippets/blobs.\r\n> \r\n> Anything one can do to get around this? Better way of hiding Adguard?\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/RuaiVmm.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/tkZXG28.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/bgFJI5O.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.11\r\nBrowser: | Edge 106.0.1370.52 (Chromium-based)\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard German\r\nUserscripts: | https://greasyfork.org/scripts/5357-remove-google-results-redirect/code/Remove%20Google%20Results%20Redirect.user.js,<br>https://greasyfork.org/scripts/18450-steam-bypass-age-confirmation-prompts/code/Steam:%20Bypass%20age%20confirmation%20prompts.user.js,<br>https://greasyfork.org/scripts/383093-twitch-disable-automatic-video-downscale/code/Twitch%20-%20Disable%20automatic%20video%20downscale.user.js,<br>C:\\Users\\marti\\OneDrive\\Anwendungen\\Adguard\\Youtube%201440p.user.js,<br>https://nightdev.com/betterttv/other/betterttv.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-wot/1.0/wot.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://www.bing.com/search?q=fritz+dect+302&cvid=cf581884581c4bc88fd942687290bf5c&aqs=edge.1.69i60j69i59j0j69i57j69i59j0l2j69i60l2.1289j0j9&PC=U531&first=1&FORM=PERE](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bing.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dfritz%2Bdect%2B302%26cvid%3Dcf581884581c4bc88fd942687290bf5c%26aqs%3Dedge.1.69i60j69i59j0j69i57j69i59j0l2j69i60l2.1289j0j9%26PC%3DU531%26first%3D1%26FORM%3DPERE)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133445/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-10-28T12:52:36Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
