Проблема заключается в том, что приложение Poweramp не загружает обложки под любым вайфаем. Под LTE или любым другим мобильным протоколом связи обложки загружаются. \r\n> Если в меню Настройки приложений-Poweramp-Настройки-Защита AdGuard выключить полностью защиту, то проблема загрузки обложек под вайфаем исчезает.\r\n> Если последовательно отключать все другие опции в Настройки приложений-Poweramp-Настройки, кроме Защита AdGuard, проблема с загрузкой не решается.\r\n> Под мобильными протоколами всё работает.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/jA9QpdE.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/WdUy69t.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 10.0\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v3.6.7\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard mode: | proxy\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Системный`<br>filters: `Системный`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Extra\r\nOther extensions used: | Нет","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/119351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/119351/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-06-03T13:11:56Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Manually toggling the browser extension on only works temporarily on that particular site. If another page is visited, or if the same page is refreshed, the browser extension automatically toggles off again.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/iiYpmbK.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/HyRFFKc.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.6.0.1040 nightly\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Java\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/mac_v2/filters/15.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Chinese\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/beta/assistant/4.3/assistant.meta.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.meta.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-wot/1.0/wot.meta.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.meta.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://accounts.google.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Faccounts.google.com%2F)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1146088917/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-06-03T15:41:06Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
