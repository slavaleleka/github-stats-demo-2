Comment\r\n> Рассказы разных писателей в Яндекс Дзене.Первая часть произведения чистая,при переходе на вторую рядом с текстом появляются подобные рекламы.Из серии-жёлтые новости,сплетни,лечение нетрадициоными методами и прочий мусор.При отключении настройки Антитрекинга-удалять параметры отслеживания,вместо страницы с текстом появляется окно с ошибкой 404(такой страницы не существует) а реклама остаётся.При включении обратно при обновлении страницы текст снова появляется,с рекламой не происходит ничего.Как висела так и висит\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n
