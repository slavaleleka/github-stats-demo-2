Please include this site as a false positive: https://www.emag.ro/ The main banners are not showing, when logged in my account, on a PC if Adguard protection is ON. This is a online store and they have great offers on that main banners and I would like to see it, in my browsers. I even used a reset on my PC for Adguard to cancel a hidden rule but it still not showing anything. \r\n> \r\n> Also, I think that it would be great that the Adguard assistant settings to also have a Unblock ad on this website option. I my case if I did push, by mistake, pushed the Block ad on this website and clicked on the main banner region I could easy and without any special knowledge undo my problem. That is why I've used the Adguard reset on my PC, but that did not worked. \r\n> \r\n> I saw that when I order something, sometimes when the pay section of the site is on display, on PC the screen is just white and I can't finish to process my payments. This I don't know if it's because of Adguard or not but it just became a problem in the past week, out of the blue.\r\n> \r\n> Thank you. Have a good day!\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/8d9w10V.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/9v1ISE3.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.10.2\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://www.emag.ro/history/shoppingdetails/265563020](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emag.ro%2Fhistory%2Fshoppingdetails%2F265563020)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/129752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/129752/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1250879095","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/129752#issuecomment-1250879095","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/129752","id":1250879095,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85KjuZ3","user":{"login":"xenudone","id":113750165,"node_id":"U_kgDOBsewlQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/113750165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone","html_url":"https://github.com/xenudone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-19T11:10:29Z","updated_at":"2022-09-19T11:10:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I see!

Please include this site as a false positive: https://www.emag.ro/ The main banners are not showing, when logged in my account, on a PC if Adguard protection is ON. This is a online store and they have great offers on that main banners and I would like to see it, in my browsers. I even used a reset on my PC for Adguard to cancel a hidden rule but it still not showing anything. \r\n> \r\n> Also, I think that it would be great that the Adguard assistant settings to also have a Unblock ad on this website option. I my case if I did push, by mistake, pushed the Block ad on this website and clicked on the main banner region I could easy and without any special knowledge undo my problem. That is why I've used the Adguard reset on my PC, but that did not worked. \r\n> \r\n> I saw that when I order something, sometimes when the pay section of the site is on display, on PC the screen is just white and I can't finish to process my payments.

Please include this site as a false positive: https://www.emag.ro/ The main banners are not showing, when logged in my account, on a PC if Adguard protection is ON. This is a online store and they have great offers on that main banners and I would like to see it, in my browsers. I even used a reset on my PC for Adguard to cancel a hidden rule but it still not showing anything. \r\n> \r\n> Also, I think that it would be great that the Adguard assistant settings to also have a Unblock ad on this website option. I my case if I did push, by mistake, pushed the Block ad on this website and clicked on the main banner region I could easy and without any special knowledge undo my problem. That is why I've used the Adguard reset on my PC, but that did not worked. \r\n> \r\n> I saw that when I order something, sometimes when the pay section of the site is on display, on PC the screen is just white and I can't finish to process my payments. This I don't know if it's because of Adguard or not but it just became a problem in the past week, out of the blue.\r\n> \r\n> Thank you. Have a good day!\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/8d9w10V.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/9v1ISE3.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.10.2\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://www.emag.ro/history/shoppingdetails/265563020](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emag.ro%2Fhistory%2Fshoppingdetails%2F265563020)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/129752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/129752/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1250850243","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/129752#issuecomment-1250850243","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/129752","id":1250850243,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85KjnXD","user":{"login":"xenudone","id":113750165,"node_id":"U_kgDOBsewlQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/113750165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone","html_url":"https://github.com/xenudone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-19T10:36:42Z","updated_at":"2022-09-19T10:36:42Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"The main banner worked with the base filter since sat, sept 17, when I\ndeleted the provided rule and let the base filter (that was updated) do the\nmagic but as of half an hour ago, again the main banner of this digital\nshop is not visible when logged in my account.
