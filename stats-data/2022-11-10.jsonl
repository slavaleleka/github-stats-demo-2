Comment\r\nUsername: @Woodpeckerbaby\r\n> Please fix the space on the top. The page is just weird. Is it possible to block more redundant JavaScript? It would be ideal if the entire page just loads without waiting for scrolling section by section. This is probably for engagement analytics. \r\n> \r\n>  Also, if you catch occasional splash screen pop ups, please block those too. Such as daily digest solicitations. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/5CoPGB7.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard/AdGuard Pro for iOS v4.4.4\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/134483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/134483/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1310124341","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/134483#issuecomment-1310124341","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/134483","id":1310124341,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85OFuk1","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-10T11:10:49Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T11:10:49Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Actually, there is no need to check this out on your end.\r\nTo block this leftover you should enable advanced protection.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1310124341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-11-10T11:10:50Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\nUsername: @Woodpeckerbaby\r\n> Please fix the space on the top. The page is just weird. Is it possible to block more redundant JavaScript? It would be ideal if the entire page just loads without waiting for scrolling section by section. This is probably for engagement analytics. \r\n> \r\n>  Also, if you catch occasional splash screen pop ups, please block those too. Such as daily digest solicitations. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/5CoPGB7.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard/AdGuard Pro for iOS v4.4.4\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/134483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/134483/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1310102876","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/134483#issuecomment-1310102876","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/134483","id":1310102876,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85OFpVc","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-10T10:53:02Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T10:53:02Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have also added rules that block the popup.\r\n@WoodpeckerBaby after checking the rule above please answer here.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1310102876/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-11-10T10:53:02Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Мне это надоело, я решила полазить в настройках вашего приложения, вдруг найду что-то полезное. Наклацала непонятно что, вроде вернула все обратно, но теперь вылезла проблема - законные две рекламы вернулись к моим просмотрам сериалов и фильмов. При этом на самом сайте много всплывающих окон и баннеров, их по прежнему не видно. Что я наклацала не знаю, в самом сафари расширение включено, с настроек все включено, если в приложение зайти то там стоит защита сафари включена. А по факту лажа.
