I received an interesting heads-up from [an owner of *Dakar Desert Rally* on PCGamingWiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Topic:X6von2hsqay3oswt), who claimed to have encountered ads in hub areas and startlines, but who allegedly found a way to block them. The supposed info was interesting enough that I'm forwarding it near-verbatim without actually having tested it myself.\r\n\r\nThe entries they suggested were:\r\n```\r\n||anzusafeframe.azureedge.net^\r\n||assets.anzuinfra.com^\r\n||caps-server.anzu.io^\r\n||emqx.anzuinfra.com^\r\n||events.anzuinfra.com^\r\n||l1-1.anzu.io^\r\n||logic.anzuinfra.com^\r\n||mgw-2.anzuinfra.com^\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther than this, the provided details were somewhat sparse, including if they used any other entries/filters for anything.\r\n\r\n3. Screenshots\r\n\r\nThey had not posted any screenshots at the time of writing.\r\n\n\n### Privacy\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this condition","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/134837/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/134837/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-11-14T04:42:37Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
