I made a mistake.\r\nThe exact URL is like this:\r\nhttps://m.cafe.naver.com/ca-fe/home/feed\r\n\r\nThe feed section, named \"새글피드\" in Korean, will show something only if you sign up on Naver cafe and then join some cafes in it.\r\n\r\nThere could be a syntax error in the rule I wrote, for I'm a fresh user.\r\n\r\nI just picked the ad element using uBlock Origin's [element picker mode] in desktop Firefox, and then edited the rule with my limited knowledge on adguard.\r\nThe original rule created on UBO when I picked the ad is this:\r\nm.cafe.naver.com##.adtype_feed\r\nwhich means \"adtype_feed\" class under m.cafe.naver.com domain.\r\n\r\nI am using AdGuard app on iOS and have enabled it as Safari extension, so the ad doesn't show up when I see the feed page on Safari. But it 'does' except on Safari.\r\nI'd also like to block the ad on Firefox or Naver cafe app on iOS, using AdGuard DNS.\r\nI know Safari extension doesn't work on Firefox.\r\nThus, I hope you add some rule to your DNS system to block the above ad, as a lot of ads are being blocked by your DNS.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\nLet me know if you need additional info.\r\n\r\n![1BE4DAD4-E6A1-4978-962A-5C1A266EFADF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10944671/183291922-32b6db97-14ed-46b4-a553-80ea6305c3bc.png)\r\n\r\n![CF060B6F-6CF5-4ED5-A812-50E109F01B73](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10944671/183291934-721bbc43-c67a-496d-adf0-6ad0b3918fb7.png)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1207404009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-08-07T13:03:15Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

just installed AdGuard Adblock on Firefox on Windows.\r\n\r\nI reloaded the Naver feed webpage, and did these in order:\r\n1) clicked [Block ads on this website] on AdGuard add-on panel on
