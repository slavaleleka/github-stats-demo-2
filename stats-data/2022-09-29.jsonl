Please read carefully as this was reported but only resulted in the example used to illustrate getting whitelisted, and this affects numerous domains, with new ones every day - we are a service provider with forms on thousands of domains, all users of these forms are affected. Forms provided by SharpSpring from Constant Contact do not display on sites using them when AdGuard's tracking protection is enabled. The script to display forms is separate from the tracking script.\r\n2. The tracking script in ss.js creates a cookie and allows for tracking. The script in form.js generates the form, but will not track if ss.js was blocked from creating the cookie.\r\n3. Note that the subdomain for the script is slightly different for each customer. In the sshtml example below, the tracking script is loaded via https://koi-3QNDUN6A20.marketingautomation.services/client/ss.js?ver=2.4.0\r\nAnd the form script is loaded via https://koi-3qnegvsspc.marketingautomation.services/client/form.js?ver=2.0.1\r\nThe subdomain beginning with 'koi' will be different for each domain and customer.\r\n4. The rules that EasyList use properly block tracking, but not the forms.\r\nSee the EasyList tracking blocking rules here, and look for the domain 'marketingautomation.services':\r\nhttps://easylist.to/easylist/easyprivacy.txt\r\n5. If you want to block tracking, blocking ss.js will do that. The form.js will work as a form, but not track, if ss.js has not generated the cookie. \r\n\r\n6.
