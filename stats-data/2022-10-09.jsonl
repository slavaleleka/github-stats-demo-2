When moving your mouse cursor away from the page, perhaps towards one's browser toolbar, a desperate pop-up appears begging you not to leave. Adguard is powerless against this because they use a javascript lightbox to darken the page and their message sits on top of it. If you use AdGuard to suppress the message (elements) the lightbox element remains. Then you cannot suppress it or interact with the page anymore. So frustrating! \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/CJyfUzx.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.6\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/131721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/131721/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-10-09T07:51:27Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

I can see the URL change on top of the tab and the last time it opened a shop for cloths or sth. This time it was blocked (the content) as per the screenshot. My main concern is why the redirects happen at all, this issue sort of happened all of a sudden. I had it before (like a year ago) and it stopped and now its back.
