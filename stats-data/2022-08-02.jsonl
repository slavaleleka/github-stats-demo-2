\r\n> Il manque un bouton rapide sur le popup de l'extension pour désactiver le blocage des nuisances uniquement pour certains sites, tout en bloquant les trackers.\r\n> \r\n> Actuellement, il faut retourner dans les réglages, désactiver, recharger la page, accepter les cookies, puis retourner dans les réglages pour activer les filtres pour enfin recharger la page.\r\n> \r\n> C'est insupportable, problème qui ne se pose pas avec ublock qui permet de désactiver les filtres esthétiques, et qui m'empêche de recommander Adguard à des néophytes en informatique.\r\n> \r\n>
