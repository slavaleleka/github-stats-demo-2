@kuchacoda\r\n> Здравствуйте. Помогите пожалуйста решить проблему конфликтов фильтра AdGuard Russian FIlter.\r\n> Мы уже неоднократно замечали, что это правило ломает плеер в определенных случаях:\r\n> \r\n> /:\\/\\/([a-z-]{6}\\.)?(?!aniqit)[a-z0-9]{4,}\\.(com|in\\.net|link|tech|ru)/$xmlhttprequest,domain=aniqit.com|kodik.info|start.u-cdn.top|ustore.bz|u-stream.in\r\n> \r\n> В этоп правиле домены плеера это только aniqit.com и kodik.info. Остальные это уже другие плееры и не знаю почему они все в одном правиле.\r\n> \r\n> Суть в том, что при определенном стечении обстоятельств (возможно это зависит от конкретного поддомена CDN, который отдается при скачивании видео) блокировщик рекламы блокирует не только рекламу, но и само видео.\r\n> \r\n> Вообще данное правило лично для меня выглядит очень сложным и я не до конца понимаю как оно рабоатет, но мне кажется именно домены aniqit.com и kodik.info можно из него спокойно убрать, так как вся реклама в плеере Kodik блокируется множеством других правил. А конкретно это правило я видел только в случаях, когда пользователи жаловались на то, что у них не работает плеер (и у самого также случались такие проблемы).\r\n> \r\n> Буду очень благодарен, если вы можете решить данную проблему.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/9y5AJzy.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/fzQQIQt.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/07hZryj.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | uBlock Origin AdGuard Russian Filter\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nFilters: | <b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/128521/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/128521/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1240883424","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/128521#issuecomment-1240883424","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/128521","id":1240883424,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85J9mDg","user":{"login":"kuchacoda","id":88550619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NTUwNjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/88550619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuchacoda","html_url":"https://github.com/kuchacoda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuchacoda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuchacoda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuchacoda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuchacoda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuchacoda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuchacoda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuchacoda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuchacoda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuchacoda/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-08T15:34:06Z","updated_at":"2022-09-08T15:34:06Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Здравствуйте. Извиняюсь за долгий ответ.\r\n\r\nПо поводу адресов пример в третьем скриншоте. Я честно сам не понимаю почему он реагирует только в каких-то отдельных случаях, а не каждый раз. Возможно это связано с разными поддоменами CDN, которые зависят от геолокации пользователя и расположения файла. В случае с данным примером поддомен - maxima.\r\n\r\nСкопировал ссылки из скриншота:\r\nhttps://maxima.zerocdn.com/\r\nhttps://maxima.cloud.kodik-storage.com/useruploads/a9b5a528-1e03-4e34-8c01-da3d3f993fb0/8561ca174f77808dc81aa80acda307c9:2022090100/360.mp4.hls:manifest.m3u8\r\nПервая ссылка это я так понимаю CNAME запись домена maxima.cloud.kodik-storage.com в домен maxima.zerocdn.com\r\nПо второй ссылке сейчас 404, но это нормально, так как ссылка временная. Но в любом случае по скриншоту видно, что она была заблокирована.\r\n\r\nУ себя я конечно могу включить дополнительные фильтры для исправления проблемы. Но я сомневаюсь, что пользователи сами догадаются это сделать. Скорее всего они просто подумают, что плеер не работает.\r\n\r\nНасчет фильтра, в ublock origin используется фильтр, доступный по ссылке: https://filters.adtidy.org/extension/ublock/filters/1.txt\r\nЯ сейчас уже не могу через гугл найти сайт, на котором этот фильтр раздается. Возможно, что на данный момент данный фильтр уже перестали продвигать, но у определенного количество пользователей он уже стоит. Если пройти по первой части ссылки (https://filters.adtidy.org), то она переадресует на https://adguard.com/en/welcome.html . То есть по идее этот фильтр официальный, плюс он постоянно обновляется.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1240883424/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-09-08T15:34:07Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
