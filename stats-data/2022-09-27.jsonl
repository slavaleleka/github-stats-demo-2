Comment\r\nUsername: @bsitshort\r\n> There has always been an issue with ads on edge home screen. In the past it would filter them, but as you scroll down they would eventually come back. I could go to the adguard extension and click on it and without doing anything they would dissapear again. Rinse and repeat.  But in the last few weeks they aren't filtered at all.  When you try to block them manually, it blanks out the whole page. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/qmrBRsf.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.10.2\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns-unfiltered.adguard.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `User+rules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Japanese\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Norton Security, Autoplay Stopper, Google Keep, Dark Reader","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130500/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1259223753","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130500#issuecomment-1259223753","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130500","id":1259223753,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85LDjrJ","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-27T09:18:39Z","updated_at":"2022-09-27T09:18:39Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"There is no difference for AdGuard for Windows.

i.e. 09/24/2022, from 02:39:07 Adguard Home started blocking the mpfoto.eu website. I suspect this happened after updating the filters. I manually downloaded the easylist.txt list which is the basis for blocking the page, but I did not find any string that would be responsible for this blocking. I am the owner of this domain, only what this site does is redirect the customer to my private OLX sales account and it has been for several years.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/vtXy2wn.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/DDJLTaP.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | AdguardHome v0.107.13\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nCustom filters: | AdAway Default Block List,<br>POL: Polish filters for Pi hole,<br>WindowsSpyBlocker - Hosts spy rules,<br>Official Polish Filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130552/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1259172423","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130552#issuecomment-1259172423","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130552","id":1259172423,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85LDXJH","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-27T08:35:04Z","updated_at":"2022-09-27T08:35:04Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"AdGuard DNS filter does not block it.

As a user, i think the [BaseFilter](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/tree/master/BaseFilter/sections) is based on the English language. So, i think it is unnecessary for English-only users to have the [foreign](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/BaseFilter/sections/foreign.txt) filter listed in the [BaseFilter](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/tree/master/BaseFilter/sections).\n\n### Proposed solution\n\n[foreign](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/blob/master/BaseFilter/sections/foreign.txt) filter should be moved from [BaseFilter](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/tree/master/BaseFilter/sections) to [AdguardFilters](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters) with make a new section `ForeignFilter`. As end user i think it should be in the language specific list and according to the number of filter uses, it will be useful in terms of usage.\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130772/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130772/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1259522596","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130772#issuecomment-1259522596","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130772","id":1259522596,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85LEsok","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-27T13:37:24Z","updated_at":"2022-09-27T13:37:24Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Not a bad idea, maybe we will move that rules to separate rules.\r\nBut in any case Base filter has rules for many langs(for example, popular antiadblock rules with a lot of domains).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1259522596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-09-27T13:37:24Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Edge was listed but it occurs in Chrome etc. as well. The example is on their own page, but affects forms of all customers using Constant Contact's SharpSpring product as well, in turn affecting a large number of sites.\r\n> If the intention is to block tracking, it should block ss.js but but not form.js - however it seems to block both currently.\r\n> The rules that EasyList use properly block tracking, but not the forms.\r\n> See the EasyList tracking blocking rules here, and look for the domain 'marketingautomation.services':\r\n> https://easylist.to/easylist/easyprivacy.txt\r\n> As this is affecting the sits of many Constant Contact customers using this product, it would be very helpful if the forms were not blocked along with the tracking.
