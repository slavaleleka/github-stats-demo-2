DNS-фильтрация по пользовательскому списку не работает. При переключении протоколов с DoQ на DoH и обратно, все как бы работает и блокируется, но спустя некоторое время (2-20 минут) перестает фильтровать. Вкратце что происходит: фильтрация на DoQ--> обрыв--> переключение на DoH--> кратковременная фильтрация-->обрыв-->переключение обратно на DoQ-->опять кратковременная фильтрация-->опять обрыв. Перезагрузка интернета чаще всего ничего не дает, если был обрыв допустим на DoH, то при переподключении интернета фильтрация происходить не будет, только опять смена протокола. Пробовал: 1) Отключение брандмауэра, антивируса нет 2) Переустановка сертификата в настройках Adguard 3) Сброс кэша DNS 4) Переустановка браузера 5) Ввод ip (использую Adguard DNS) в браузере и системе.

На этом сайте не активен помощник Adguard, при том, что на других сайтах он работает исправно и блокирует всплывающие окна и т.д. и т.п. Помощник перестал работать после переустановки Adguard. Браузерный помощник так же не блокирует этот таймер. Раньше, при выборе в настройках - блокировать всплывающие окна, онлайн-консультанты и т.д. - таймер пропадал. Сейчас - нет. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/q9WWwS3.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.10.2\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nOther extensions used: | не имеется","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/126168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/126168/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1213254257","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/126168#issuecomment-1213254257","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/126168","id":1213254257,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85IUMpx","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-12T15:45:15Z","updated_at":"2022-08-12T15:45:15Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Не повторяется - наше текущее решение работает.
