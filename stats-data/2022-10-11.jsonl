Anyway, this report is to let you know that there is a tracker in Patreon emails for when you choose to load remote content (images, etc). The tracking server is shown in the screenshot as blocked because I have manually added it to the user filter. I suggest that you add it to your DNS and regular lists as well. The server is \"email.mailgun.patreon.com\" and is used to track users who load their emails. Please block it. Blocking it manually has not affected the images loading in the emails.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/BVf4Naq.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 8.0.0\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.0 nightly 24 (65)\r\nBrowser: | ProtonMail email app\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (60), <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (5), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Hide your User-Agent (), <br>Hide your IP address (107.178.250.75)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://1.1.1.1/dns-query,https://1.0.0.1/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/2_optimized.txt, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OsborneSystems/Columbia/master/Columbia.txt, https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt, https://badmojr.github.io/1Hosts/Pro/domains.txt, https://easylist.to/easylist/easyprivacy.txt, https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/3_optimized.txt, http://pgl.yoyo.org/adservers/serverlist.php?hostformat=adblockplus&mimetype=plaintext, https://abp.oisd.nl/basic/, https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/11_optimized.txt, DnsUserRules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList, <br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List, <br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List, <br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental, <br/>AdGuard DNS<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>CJX's Annoyances List, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter, <br/>Bulgarian list, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>Polish GDPR-Cookies Filters, <br/>EasyList Germany, <br/>Polish Annoyances Filters, <br/>Adblock List for Finland, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>Xfiles, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Lithuania, <br/>ROList, <br/>Thai Ads Filters, <br/>Hungarian, <br/>EasyList Polish, <br/>YousList, <br/>Icelandic ABP List, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>ChinaList+EasyList, <br/>RU AdList: Counters, <br/>EasyList Hebrew, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>EasyList Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>KAD -

I will use the Spotify Web browser instead.  I hope Adguard can also find new ways to overcome this problem where Spotify will not accept the HTTPS certificate in the Spotify App.  Maybe if you can integrate the Adguard VPN into the HTTPS Filter all of the traffic can be filtered in the Apps?

Anyway, this report is to let you know that there is a tracker in Patreon emails for when you choose to load remote content (images, etc). The tracking server is shown in the screenshot as blocked because I have manually added it to the user filter. I suggest that you add it to your DNS and regular lists as well. The server is \"email.mailgun.patreon.com\" and is used to track users who load their emails. Please block it. Blocking it manually has not affected the images loading in the emails.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/BVf4Naq.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 8.0.0\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.0 nightly 24 (65)\r\nBrowser: | ProtonMail email app\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (60), <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (5), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Hide your User-Agent (), <br>Hide your IP address (107.178.250.75)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://1.1.1.1/dns-query,https://1.0.0.1/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/2_optimized.txt, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OsborneSystems/Columbia/master/Columbia.txt, https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt, https://badmojr.github.io/1Hosts/Pro/domains.txt, https://easylist.to/easylist/easyprivacy.txt, https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/3_optimized.txt, http://pgl.yoyo.org/adservers/serverlist.php?hostformat=adblockplus&mimetype=plaintext, https://abp.oisd.nl/basic/, https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/11_optimized.txt, DnsUserRules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList, <br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List, <br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List, <br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental, <br/>AdGuard DNS<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>CJX's Annoyances List, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter, <br/>Bulgarian list, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>Polish GDPR-Cookies Filters, <br/>EasyList Germany, <br/>Polish Annoyances Filters, <br/>Adblock List for Finland, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>Xfiles, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Lithuania, <br/>ROList, <br/>Thai Ads Filters, <br/>Hungarian, <br/>EasyList Polish, <br/>YousList, <br/>Icelandic ABP List, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>ChinaList+EasyList, <br/>RU AdList: Counters, <br/>EasyList Hebrew, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>EasyList Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>KAD -

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://bstsrs.one/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbstsrs.one%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\nUsername: @kaylakm2\r\n> i have never had an issue accessing this website to watch tv shows until today. when I entered the website bstsrs.one into my browser, that message about the website being blocked by a content blocker showed up. I thought that was weird so I tried it on my iPhone 13 pro max that also has adguard installed (all the same filters) and the website works perfectly fine on my phone. So I tried my MacBook again and the same error popped up. I disabled my VPN and tried that way and it said safari couldn't find the server. so I turned my VPN back on, and randomly the website loaded on my MacBook with no error. but that only happens sometimes. I noticed that when I tried to load the website on my MacBook that it kept trying to redirect to another website (srsone.top) which is very odd because it does not redirect on my phone, it goes to the website I want (bstsrs.one). and when my MacBook randomly loads the website after switching off and on my VPN, it does not redirect. it goes to bstsrs.one. I'm just confused why this website loads without issue on my iPhone but not on my Macbook.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/sQuLqIe.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/W7849XG.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/Df1QTWM.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.7\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List\r\nOther extensions used: | honey","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/131830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/131830/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-10-11T12:52:02Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://bstsrs.one/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbstsrs.one%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\nUsername: @kaylakm2\r\n> i have never had an issue accessing this website to watch tv shows until today. when I entered the website bstsrs.one into my browser, that message about the website being blocked by a content blocker showed up. I thought that was weird so I tried it on my iPhone 13 pro max that also has adguard installed (all the same filters) and the website works perfectly fine on my phone. So I tried my MacBook again and the same error popped up. I disabled my VPN and tried that way and it said safari couldn't find the server. so I turned my VPN back on, and randomly the website loaded on my MacBook with no error. but that only happens sometimes. I noticed that when I tried to load the website on my MacBook that it kept trying to redirect to another website (srsone.top) which is very odd because it does not redirect on my phone, it goes to the website I want (bstsrs.one). and when my MacBook randomly loads the website after switching off and on my VPN, it does not redirect. it goes to bstsrs.one. I'm just confused why this website loads without issue on my iPhone but not on my Macbook.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/sQuLqIe.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/W7849XG.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/Df1QTWM.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.7\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List\r\nOther extensions used: | honey","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/131830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/131830/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1274641124","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/131830#issuecomment-1274641124","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/131830","id":1274641124,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85L-Xrk","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-11T12:52:01Z","updated_at":"2022-10-11T12:52:01Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@kaylakm2 Hi.
