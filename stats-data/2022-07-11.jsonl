Your comment_**\r\n\r\nHi. First of all, sorry for the delay.\r\n\r\nIn short, these two issues can _probably_ be explained either by a glitch (see in particular the fact that two instances of AdGuard are used simultaneously on one of the two issues, both of which seem to me to come from the same person by the way) or by the fact that some premium content (coming from their partnership with _6play_ here) would _potentially_ not use `.featPlayerAds`. Although that doesn't seem to be the case.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the current solution, although never faulty in my tests, is a bit fragile on a glitch level because it must be correctly defined once the DOM of the page is loaded _(document)_ but before its use ~ 2 sec. later in `main.[…].js` _(script)_.\r\n\r\nTherefore, for the possible rare case where my `set-constant` line wouldn't react fast enough, added:\r\n- its `$document,replace=[…]` version (for AG products supporting it);\r\n- a deletion of the following JSON content via the `json-prune` scriptlet, where `*` is any ad provider name:\r\n  - `ads.*.default` _[binary]_ (to allow to never see [that](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4764956/141113868-85bdb3d1-1f24-4ac2-ac20-0000afc560b9.png) in this situation too — English translation: \"Advertising: Your content is loading\");\r\n  - `ads.*.url` _[string]_ (to prevent contacting any ad provider, currently two present, now or later; with `ads.enableAntiAdBlocking` removed alongside);\r\n  - `ads.enableMidrolls` _[binary]_ (to prevent any possible/future 'OSD' visual stuff showing before trying to show them).\r\n\r\nThe final `, 'ads'` _(another parameter)_ being for optimization purposes: if I understand it correctly, this will allow in this case for each \"JSON data\" where the `[ROOT].ads` property is absent, to only look for its presence once instead of 3 times.\r\n\r\n**_2.

AdGuard прекрасно блокировал рекламу. Да, она там была всегда, но при включённом AdGuard не было никакой рекламы. И только после недавнего обновления приложения АйДаПрикол, даже при включенном AdGuard реклама через каждые 5-7 постов. Видимо, разработчики АйДаПрикола сумели обойти AdGuard.

AdGuard прекрасно блокировал рекламу. Да, она там была всегда, но при включённом AdGuard не было никакой рекламы. И только после недавнего обновления приложения АйДаПрикол, даже при включенном AdGuard реклама через каждые 5-7 постов. Видимо, разработчики АйДаПрикола сумели обойти AdGuard.

AdGuard прекрасно блокировал рекламу. Да, она там была всегда, но при включённом AdGuard не было никакой рекламы. И только после недавнего обновления приложения АйДаПрикол, даже при включенном AdGuard реклама через каждые 5-7 постов. Видимо, разработчики АйДаПрикола сумели обойти AdGuard. Надеюсь, это ненадолго )) Спасибо за ваше приложение в любом случае!\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/y5T8Zzs.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 9\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v3.6.8 (46)\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (4320), <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties (), <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties, <br>Hide your User-Agent (), <br>Hide your IP address (209.141.53.254)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List, <br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental, <br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion, <br/>AdGuard DNS<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>ABPindo, <br/>Polish Anti-Annoying Special Supplement, <br/>List-KR, <br/>Hungarian, <br/>CJX's Annoyances List, <br/>EasyList Spanish, <br/>Thai Ads Filters, <br/>ROLIST2, <br/>road-block, <br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>KAD - Anti-Scam, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>Liste FR, <br/>Adblock List for Finland, <br/>Official Polish filters for AdBlock, uBlock Origin & AdGuard, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>Polish Annoyances Filters, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>xinggsf, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>YousList, <br/>AdBlockID, <br/>Icelandic ABP List, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>EasyList Lithuania, <br/>EasyList Dutch, <br/>Bulgarian list, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters, <br/>Polish Social Filters, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>Estonian List, <br/>ROList, <br/>EasyList Hebrew, <br/>EasyList China, <br/>EasyList Germany, <br/>Polish GDPR-Cookies Filters, <br/>ChinaList+EasyList, <br/>Latvian List, <br/>ABPVN List, <br/>Iranian, <br/>Xfiles, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>RU AdList: Counters, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>EasyList Polish, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter, <br/>AlleBlock, <br/>Greek AdBlock Filter</details>\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/disable-amp/1.0/disable-amp.meta.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Нет","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/124069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/124069/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-07-11T17:08:24Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Your comment_**\r\n\r\nHi. First of all, sorry for the delay.\r\n\r\nIn short, these two issues can _probably_ be explained either by a glitch (see in particular the fact that two instances of AdGuard are used simultaneously on one of the two issues, both of which seem to me to come from the same person by the way) or by the fact that some premium content (coming from their partnership with _6play_ here) would _potentially_ not use `.featPlayerAds`. Although that doesn't seem to be the case.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the current solution, although never faulty in my tests, is a bit fragile on a glitch level because it must be correctly defined once the DOM of the page is loaded _(document)_ but before its use ~ 2 sec. later in `main.[…].js` _(script)_.\r\n\r\nTherefore, for the possible rare case where my `set-constant` line wouldn't react fast enough, added:\r\n- its `$document,replace=[…]` version (for AG products supporting it);\r\n- a deletion of the following JSON content via the `json-prune` scriptlet, where `*` is any ad provider name:\r\n  - `ads.*.default` _[binary]_ (to allow to never see [that](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4764956/141113868-85bdb3d1-1f24-4ac2-ac20-0000afc560b9.png) in this situation too — English translation: \"Advertising: Your content is loading\");\r\n  - `ads.*.url` _[string]_ (to prevent contacting any ad provider, currently two present, now or later; with `ads.enableAntiAdBlocking` removed alongside);\r\n  - `ads.enableMidrolls` _[binary]_ (to prevent any possible/future 'OSD' visual stuff showing before trying to show them).\r\n\r\nThe final `, 'ads'` _(another parameter)_ being for optimization purposes: if I understand it correctly, this will allow in this case for each \"JSON data\" where the `[ROOT].ads` property is absent, to only look for its presence once instead of 3 times.\r\n\r\n**_2.
