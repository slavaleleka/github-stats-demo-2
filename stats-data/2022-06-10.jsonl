A lot of ads from porn site like junktraffic and some other advertising annoyances have managed to bypass Ad Gaurs up-to-date filters on Safari not matter what I do. And even using a DNS filter on my iPad Pro 12.9 inch 2nd Generation running on iPad OS 15+ is still unable to block or filter many of the ads that still appear. Regardless I used Brave built in ad blocking, or try to use DNS filter app with decloudus DNS filter.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/QhtvC3X.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard/AdGuard Pro for iOS v4.4.0\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener\r\nOther extensions used: | Just this app.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/121452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/121452/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-06-10T20:09:59Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
