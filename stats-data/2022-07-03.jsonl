There is a complication here. Block does not work regardless of whether the custom rule (user filter) is on or off. It does not work on all sites with any user rule. I also have Adguard Home on my router. The only way to solve it at the moment is to run Adguard Blocker (not Adguard Assistant) at the same time. With importing the same rules into the user filter it  works fine. By the way, I visited the same site on Chrome and was blocked without any problem (even without Adguard Blocker).\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/ST8B9Gz.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/mn7RlFx.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.9.1\r\nBrowser: | Iridium(a Chromium Browser)\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Hide your User-Agent (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/101.0.4951.41 Safari/537.36)\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>EasyList, <br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>EasyList China, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard Japanese\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js,<br>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reek/anti-adblock-killer/master/anti-adblock-killer.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://bgm.tv/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbgm.tv%2F)\r\nOther extensions used: | Bitdefender Anti-Tracker","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/121986/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/121986/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1173026344","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/121986#issuecomment-1173026344","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/121986","id":1173026344,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85F6vYo","user":{"login":"Ishiharaerika","id":87614796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjE0Nzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87614796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiharaerika","html_url":"https://github.com/Ishiharaerika","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiharaerika/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiharaerika/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiharaerika/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiharaerika/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiharaerika/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiharaerika/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiharaerika/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiharaerika/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ishiharaerika/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-03T07:10:08Z","updated_at":"2022-07-03T07:10:08Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> @xmydl520 Hi.
