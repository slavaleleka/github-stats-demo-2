Comment\r\nUsername: @whuihuan\r\n> 我是网站方的管理者，我需要为这一块内容解释一下。\r\n> 这一块内容是网站的宣传轮播，因为本网站为东方project的社群维基，内容均与东方project相关。该轮播的作用是宣传东方相关的创作、引导购买正版东方project官方作品（如截图上的《东方文果真报》就是东方project官方发售的刊物）、网站公告（例如东方project作者ZUN的生日）、THBWiki附属项目（例如幻想乡柱状地图网页版、东方版人格测试、东方音乐索引站）等作用，并非是与站点内容无关的收益化广告。adguard错误的将其屏蔽会导致一些刚认识东方project的用户失去了解一些东方最新相关的内容，并且会对网站的布局产生影响（例如空了一大块），希望adguard团队能正确判断用户提交的广告举报，避免因为错误的举报导致网站正常功能使用收到影响。\r\n\r\n###
