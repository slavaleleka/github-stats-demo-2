It could be that this is from around the time I installed MAC OS Ventura. Not sure though. There is no difference between having Adguard for Safari switched on or off. I did not install any new extensions and everything is like it used to be before the problem occurred. i deleted and reinstalled adguard for safari several times but the problem keeps occurring. I also installed the other app simply named 'adguard' which also has a browser extension built in, this one also keeps showing as, here the little adguard extension icon also always is stuck on pause and i cant get it out of pause. I also installed this version of adguard several times without success. I also installed other adblockers but they all don't seem to black ads anymore, what could be the reason?\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/xEpZlvi.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/McMaOxQ.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.7\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Dutch\r\nOther extensions used: | none","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/134363/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/134363/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-11-08T00:49:05Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Com o AdGuard desativado tudo funciona normalmente.\r\n> \r\n> Hi. I can't reproduce. Is this issue related to enabled filters?\r\n\r\nYes! I found out the problem is with AdGuard base filter. The list enabled makes a lot of sites work really slower. Twitter and Youtube for example. The youtube website crash if you keep scrolling and navigating, activating miniplayer.

Then for some reason I had to re-enter my product key, and ever since then it's been not working well anymore. Mostly seeing the \"webpage not available\" error where the ads would be, but also big blank spaces where ads would be, several \"annoyances\" sneak through (some are ads and some are \"webpage not available\" text), and ads appear (seems like many but not all, maybe like 70-80% of them) in my news feed when they didn't used to. \r\n> \r\n> Why did it stop working?? I literally didn't change anything about the program. It worked, then I noticed it wasn't working at all and that I was using 0 of 3 keys and had to enter it again, then (now) it's not working right at all.

Comment\r\nUsername: @Stjernix\r\n> It worked for a while! Then for some reason I had to re-enter my product key, and ever since then it's been not working well anymore. Mostly seeing the \"webpage not available\" error where the ads would be, but also big blank spaces where ads would be, several \"annoyances\" sneak through (some are ads and some are \"webpage not available\" text), and ads appear (seems like many but not all, maybe like 70-80% of them) in my news feed when they didn't used to. \r\n> \r\n> Why did it stop working?? I literally didn't change anything about the program. It worked, then I noticed it wasn't working at all and that I was using 0 of 3 keys and had to enter it again, then (now) it's not working right at all. I'm very sad!\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/DVvkdon.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/v34jNlW.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/BI3wnCD.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 4</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 4](https://reports-img.adguard.com/HAj1ghr.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 5</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 5](https://reports-img.adguard.com/IWil2vT.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 12\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v3.6.10+(51)\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Self-destructing third-party cookies (0)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `System`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js\r\nOther extensions used: | BitDefender","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/134368/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/134368/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1306722698","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/134368#issuecomment-1306722698","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/134368","id":1306722698,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85N4wGK","user":{"login":"AdamWr","id":29142494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQyNDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29142494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamWr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-08T07:01:19Z","updated_at":"2022-11-08T07:01:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"As far as I understand, it's general problem not only related to reported website.\r\nIf so, then please contact with technical support - https://kb.adguard.com/technical-support","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1306722698/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-11-08T07:01:19Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
