It could be that this is from around the time I installed MAC OS Ventura. Not sure though. There is no difference between having Adguard for Safari switched on or off. I did not install any new extensions and everything is like it used to be before the problem occurred. i deleted and reinstalled adguard for safari several times but the problem keeps occurring. I also installed the other app simply named 'adguard' which also has a browser extension built in, this one also keeps showing as, here the little adguard extension icon also always is stuck on pause and i cant get it out of pause. I also installed this version of adguard several times without success. I also installed other adblockers but they all don't seem to black ads anymore, what could be the reason?\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/xEpZlvi.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/McMaOxQ.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.7\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Dutch\r\nOther extensions used: | none","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/134363/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/134363/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-11-08T00:49:05Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
