Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [http://yandex.ru](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fyandex.ru)\r\n### Comment\r\nUsername: @Carpocalips\r\n> Есть телефон Xiaomi на андроид 10 с MIUI 12 и есть только купленный Xiaomi на андроид 12 с MIUI 13. И там и там стоят браузер Яндекс и там и там есть adguar с абсолютно одинаковыми настройками браузера и блокировщика. \r\n> В настройке \"Режим фильтрации\" включен \"Локальный VPN\" и если в старом телефоне это не вызывает никаких проблем, то в новом она есть, ни на одном сайте нельзя войти в свои учётные записи, то есть вводим логин/пароль и после нажатия \"вход\" страница просто перезагружается и снова с чистыми полями, так даже на самом яндексе.\r\n> Если переключиться на \"Локальный прокси\", то эта проблема исчезает в браузере и можно спокойно войти на любой сайт под своими данными, но и фильтрация рекламы работает хуже, пропуская её в приложениях и где-то на сайтах. Если снова включить \"Локальный VPN\", то все страницы сбрасываются и снова поля логин/пароль не принимаются браузером.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/twCXfOj.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/6TqCB0X.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 12\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v3.6.8 (46)\r\nBrowser: | Yandex\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Self-destructing first-party cookies (0), <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (0), <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Location API\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.adguard.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>EasyList, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>Legitimate URL Shortener, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List, <br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>EasyList Cookie List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdBlockID\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.meta.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Больше ничего нет, кроме стандартного набора в MIUI 13","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1150538278/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-06-09T00:18:06Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://www.youtube.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Beginning earlier this week, I've had some issues with AdGuard blocking ads on YouTube. The first thing I noticed is that video thumbnail images won't load, and that sometimes ads would load while watching videos. I've been using AdGuard for probably over a year now and haven't noticed any ads on YouTube before. I began manually blocking ads using AdGuard. I clicked on one to block it manually, but it seemed to block the entire YouTube site, basically. It was a small box I didn't think it would delete so much of the page!! Anyways, thumbnails weren't loading and some ads were loading beginning earlier this week, before I started blocking ads manually. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/B1eLLDu.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/GzVV3mc.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.0.181\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>Icelandic ABP List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Nordic Filters\r\nOther extensions used: | I use a gmail and a weather extension","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1150621699/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-06-09T03:13:19Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
