All other filters work perfectly (Ads, Social Widgets, Trackers, etc). I verified it one by one. The problem is exclusively with AdGuard Annoyances Filter. And only with the Content Blocker, the Advanced Blocker works fine (Advanced rules). My guess would be that one rule with unsupported syntax managed to bypass the Safari Filter Converter (one one rule contains unsupported syntax, the whole filter stops working). Perhaps this has to do with AdGuard recent change where the Annoyances Filter was split into different categories.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/nHwVr1y.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.6\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nFilters: | <b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/125746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/125746/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1200268081","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/125746#issuecomment-1200268081","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/125746","id":1200268081,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85HiqMx","user":{"login":"adguard-bot","id":30082422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDgyNDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30082422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/adguard-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-30T18:10:02Z","updated_at":"2022-07-30T18:10:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n### Issue URL (Annoyance)\r\n [https://www.applesfera.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.applesfera.com%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> Regarding my previous report of AdGuard Annoyances Filter being broken, I managed to narrow it down to one file (picture attached) : 'Other annoyances'\r\n> \r\n> I added each of them to AdGuard custom filter and try each combination until I concluded the problem was with that particular filter.

All other filters work perfectly (Ads, Social Widgets, Trackers, etc). I verified it one by one. The problem is exclusively with AdGuard Annoyances Filter. And only with the Content Blocker, the Advanced Blocker works fine (Advanced rules). My guess would be that one rule with unsupported syntax managed to bypass the Safari Filter Converter (one one rule contains unsupported syntax, the whole filter stops working). Perhaps this has to do with AdGuard recent change where the Annoyances Filter was split into different categories.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/nHwVr1y.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.6\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nFilters: | <b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/125746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/125746/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1200273412","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/125746#issuecomment-1200273412","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/125746","id":1200273412,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85HirgE","user":{"login":"adguard-bot","id":30082422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDgyNDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30082422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/adguard-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-30T18:32:57Z","updated_at":"2022-07-30T18:32:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n### Issue URL (Annoyance)\r\n [https://www.applesfera.com/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.applesfera.com%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> took me a while but I finally found the problematic rules that were breaking the Annoyances Filter in Safari.
