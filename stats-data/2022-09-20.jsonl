Comment\r\n> This is a Macbook app named \" send anywhere \".\r\n> \r\n> as you can see in the screenshot, the big blank ad pops up at the bottom.\r\n> \r\n> This big ad pops up at the \"HISTORY\" section of the app when I am done sending the files to other pc etc.\r\n> Please do not forget the ad only pops up once you are done sending the file and then for the brief moment , you switch back from the \"History\" section to the \"Transfer\" sectin of the app and then again switching to the \"History\" section and then you would see the Big ADD.\r\n> \r\n> Please help me remove this.\r\n> \r\n> Thankyou\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/kOocc94.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System

При попытке запроса данных с сайта выдаёт сообщение что соединение сброшено. Когда выключаю программу  AdGuard VPN сайт загружается нормально. Пробовал менять DNS адрес, но не помогает. Наверное, опять что-то химичат из РКН.
