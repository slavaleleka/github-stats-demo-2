Проблема заключается в том, что приложение Poweramp не загружает обложки под любым вайфаем. Под LTE или любым другим мобильным протоколом связи обложки загружаются. \r\n> Если в меню Настройки приложений-Poweramp-Настройки-Защита AdGuard выключить полностью защиту, то проблема загрузки обложек под вайфаем исчезает.\r\n> Если последовательно отключать все другие опции в Настройки приложений-Poweramp-Настройки, кроме Защита AdGuard, проблема с загрузкой не решается.\r\n> Под мобильными протоколами всё работает.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/jA9QpdE.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/WdUy69t.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 10.0\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v3.6.7\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard mode: | proxy\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `Системный`<br>filters: `Системный`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Extra\r\nOther extensions used: | Нет","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/119351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/119351/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1153738830","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/119351#issuecomment-1153738830","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/119351","id":1153738830,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85ExKhO","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-13T10:19:49Z","updated_at":"2022-06-13T10:19:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"@Eugene-Savenko Скорее баг.
