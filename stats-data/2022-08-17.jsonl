The script hides the controller using a class, and I didn't removed this class:\r\n```\r\nlimehd.tv#%#//scriptlet('remove-class', 'video-sdk-container--up', '#video-sdk-container', 'stay')\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough your solution is more optimal, since it is only an exception.\r\n\r\nThanks for the tips and sorry! 🙂
