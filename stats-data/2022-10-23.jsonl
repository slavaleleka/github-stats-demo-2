 \n    \n  \n  \n    Hmm, I didn't think about them being news and not ads, but they're\n    just clickbait.\n    They essentially are ads, because each one links to a page\n    on the site where you can sign up (PAY) to read the full press\n    releases for those headlines.\n    \n    I just know they're something I don't want to see and thought I\n    could block 'em with a filter.\n    Many times in the past I've used the filters to block dividers or\n    blank spaces effectively. Those aren't ads either, but the filters\n    still worked. That's why I was flummoxed why they didn't work on\n    these links even when I set the slider to max and thought I was\n    blocking the entire section those links are in; it did until the\n    page refreshed.\n    \n    Blocklists do a good job of blocking buttons and annoyances (most of\n    the time), but these articles are an annoyance to me and didn't\n    appear until recently (I've used this site daily for years).\n    I use several privacy apps and rarely see ads, but it seems I need\n    something more to block...junk I just want to block for whatever\n    reason.\n    \n    Your filter suggestion didn't work.
