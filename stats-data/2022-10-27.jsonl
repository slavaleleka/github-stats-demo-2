The app of \"Mercado Libre\" in Android connects every time when you open the app connects to graph.facebook.com to track you and give personalized ads. I think that you can add this rule \"||graph.facebook.com^$app=com.mercadolibre\" to a filter of AdGuard, like AdGuard for Spanish/Portuguese (because MercadoLibre is a major Latin America company) or AdGuard Tracker Protection.
