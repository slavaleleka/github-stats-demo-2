The app of \"Mercado Libre\" in Android connects every time when you open the app connects to graph.facebook.com to track you and give personalized ads. I think that you can add this rule \"||graph.facebook.com^$app=com.mercadolibre\" to a filter of AdGuard, like AdGuard for Spanish/Portuguese (because MercadoLibre is a major Latin America company) or AdGuard Tracker Protection.

The app \"Racional\" in Android connects every time when you open the app connects to graph.facebook.com to track you and give personalized ads. I think that you can add this rule \"||graph.facebook.com^$app=cl.racional.app\" to a filter of AdGuard, like AdGuard for Spanish/Portuguese (because Racional is an app for inversions of Chile ) or AdGuard Tracker Protection.

Because of social media filters, on site is not possible to choose a seat, or how many tickets should have been reserved. I turned off other filters, and only social media blokers seem to affect this site. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/QqDy1aJ.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/rmydWlB.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.7\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nFilters: | <b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133324/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133324/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1293397238","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133324#issuecomment-1293397238","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133324","id":1293397238,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85NF6z2","user":{"login":"jellizaveta","id":91964807,"node_id":"U_kgDOBXtFhw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91964807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta","html_url":"https://github.com/jellizaveta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jellizaveta/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-27T11:38:04Z","updated_at":"2022-10-27T11:38:04Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I could not reproduce the incorrect blockage.  @AdamWr please, take a look","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1293397238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-10-27T11:38:04Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

The app \"Racional\" in Android connects every time when you open the app connects to graph.facebook.com to track you and give personalized ads. I think that you can add this rule \"||graph.facebook.com^$app=cl.racional.app\" to a filter of AdGuard, like AdGuard for Spanish/Portuguese (because Racional is an app for inversions of Chile ) or AdGuard Tracker Protection.
