Anyway, this report is to let you know that there is a tracker in Patreon emails for when you choose to load remote content (images, etc). The tracking server is shown in the screenshot as blocked because I have manually added it to the user filter. I suggest that you add it to your DNS and regular lists as well. The server is \"email.mailgun.patreon.com\" and is used to track users who load their emails. Please block it. Blocking it manually has not affected the images loading in the emails.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/BVf4Naq.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 8.0.0\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.0 nightly 24 (65)\r\nBrowser: | ProtonMail email app\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Block third-party Authorization header, <br>Self-destructing first-party cookies (60), <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (5), <br>Disable cache for third-party requests, <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Location API, <br>Hide your User-Agent (), <br>Hide your IP address (107.178.250.75)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://1.1.1.1/dns-query,https://1.0.0.1/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/2_optimized.txt, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OsborneSystems/Columbia/master/Columbia.txt, https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/15_optimized.txt, https://badmojr.github.io/1Hosts/Pro/domains.txt, https://easylist.to/easylist/easyprivacy.txt, https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/3_optimized.txt, http://pgl.yoyo.org/adservers/serverlist.php?hostformat=adblockplus&mimetype=plaintext, https://abp.oisd.nl/basic/, https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/11_optimized.txt, DnsUserRules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList, <br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List, <br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>NoCoin Filter List, <br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental, <br/>AdGuard DNS<br/><br/><details><summary><b>Language-specific:</b></summary>CJX's Annoyances List, <br/>Frellwit's Swedish Filter, <br/>Bulgarian list, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>Polish GDPR-Cookies Filters, <br/>EasyList Germany, <br/>Polish Annoyances Filters, <br/>Adblock List for Finland, <br/>Liste AR, <br/>Xfiles, <br/>AdGuard Japanese, <br/>EasyList Czech and Slovak, <br/>EasyList Lithuania, <br/>ROList, <br/>Thai Ads Filters, <br/>Hungarian, <br/>EasyList Polish, <br/>YousList, <br/>Icelandic ABP List, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>ChinaList+EasyList, <br/>RU AdList: Counters, <br/>EasyList Hebrew, <br/>Polish Anti Adblock Filters, <br/>EasyList Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Turkish, <br/>KAD -
