Comment\r\n> На рекламных баннерах в сафари наверное специально для адгвард написано \"реклама\", цинично так. \r\n> И эта реклама не глушится никак. \r\n> Адгвард недавно заставили меня купить версию \"про\", выкинул в помойку ещё чуть более 500 рублей \"навсегда\" и рекламы стало ещё больше. \r\n> Включено всё по вашей рекомендации, результатов ноль, рекламой заблёван весь смартфон. \r\n> Так же абсолютно не фильтруется трафик приложений, в играх, например, где после каждого уровня как дурилка на ниточке выскакивает какая-нибудь идиотская орущая реклама, по 30 секунд, которую никак не закрыть. \r\n> Адгвард ещё работает или сдались?\r\n> А вот эта капча перед отправкой сообщения - это что за архаизм?\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n
