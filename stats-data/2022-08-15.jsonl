Comment\r\n> На рекламных баннерах в сафари наверное специально для адгвард написано \"реклама\", цинично так. \r\n> И эта реклама не глушится никак. \r\n> Адгвард недавно заставили меня купить версию \"про\", выкинул в помойку ещё чуть более 500 рублей \"навсегда\" и рекламы стало ещё больше. \r\n> Включено всё по вашей рекомендации, результатов ноль, рекламой заблёван весь смартфон. \r\n> Так же абсолютно не фильтруется трафик приложений, в играх, например, где после каждого уровня как дурилка на ниточке выскакивает какая-нибудь идиотская орущая реклама, по 30 секунд, которую никак не закрыть. \r\n> Адгвард ещё работает или сдались?\r\n> А вот эта капча перед отправкой сообщения - это что за архаизм?\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n

Prerequisites\n\n- [X] This site DOES NOT contains sexually explicit material, otherwise use [NSFW-specific form](./new?template=bug_report_NSFW.yml);\n- [X] Filters were updated before reproducing an issue;\n- [X] AdGuard product version is up-to-date;\n- [X] Browser version is up-to-date;\n- [X] If the site or app is broken, disabling AdGuard protection resolves an issue.\n\n### What product do you use?\n\nAdGuard DNS\n\n### AdGuard version\n\nadguard-dns.io\n\n### What type of problem have you encountered?\n\nWebsite or app doesn't work properly\n\n### Which browser(s) do you use?\n\nthe problem is with app, not a site\n\n### Which device do you use?\n\nMobile\n\n### Where is the problem encountered?\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spotify.music\n\n### What filters do you have enabled?\n\nAdGuard DNS filter\n\n### What Stealth Mode options do you have enabled?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add your comment and screenshots\n\n##### To reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. With my DNS set to `c6-----.d.adguard-dns.com` in Android's settings.\r\n\r\n2. Open Spotify on the phone while playing songs on another device, it does not show the current playing song or controls for changing it. It does not download any song.\r\n\r\n3. Put something to play on the phone itself, then I don't see any new scrobbles on https://www.last.fm/user/PeHLC (even after songs ends).\r\n\r\n##### To temporarily fix it:\r\n\r\n4. Changes my DNS to `one.one.one.one` in Android's settings.\r\n\r\n5. Restarts Spotify on phone.\r\n\r\n6. Songs start to download, songs playing in other machines suddenly appears, past scrobbles are submitted to Last.fm and can be seen in my profile.\r\n\r\n##### Other details:\r\n\r\n1. I have a cookie in adguard-dns.io that says `user:\"32362--\"`\r\n\r\n2. Searching for Spotify blocked queries in statistics shows nothing in the past 7 days: https://adguard-dns.io/en/dashboard/statistics/query?limit=20&statuses%5B0%5D=REQUEST_BLOCKED&statuses%5B1%5D=RESPONSE_BLOCKED&companies%5B0%5D=spotify&retention=DAYS_7\r\n\r\n3.

\r\n> Il manque un bouton rapide sur le popup de l'extension pour désactiver le blocage des nuisances uniquement pour certains sites, tout en bloquant les trackers.\r\n> \r\n> Actuellement, il faut retourner dans les réglages, désactiver, recharger la page, accepter les cookies, puis retourner dans les réglages pour activer les filtres pour enfin recharger la page.\r\n> \r\n> C'est insupportable, problème qui ne se pose pas avec ublock qui permet de désactiver les filtres esthétiques, et qui m'empêche de recommander Adguard à des néophytes en informatique.\r\n> \r\n>

Hello, I'm a Korean.\r\n> First, as I am not good at English I hope you understand well.\r\n> I have a trivial problem in mobile Edge inside Secure Folder, which is supported by Samsung Electronics.\r\n> I recently found the folder very useful.\r\n> But although I already had installed Adguard in my cell phone, all apps inside the folder showed me ads.\r\n> I found I need to install Adguard there again.\r\n> I logged in and registered the license.\r\n> And then, most apps didn't show me ads there.\r\n> But some websites still did in mobile Edge and Chrome, despite Adguard.\r\n> I attached a screenshot in the previous step.\r\n> What I wanna say is the websites didn't show me ads outside the folder, but if inside the folder, they still did.\r\n> I don't know my words made you understand.\r\n> I'm looking forward to your replies.\r\n> Have a good day!\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

Comment\r\n> www.channel5.com used to work fine until just-recently, but now it detects AdGuard and displays the following error when you attempt to watch any programme or live TV: \"Please disable Ad Blocker to make sure you have the best experiencing watching content on My5\".  I have tried enabling the \"Annoyances\" filter (I turned the parent category on, so all child blockers were all on) but after refreshing the page and deleting cookies it made no difference and still detects AdGuard.  Page only works when it is disabled (see screenshots). \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/FM5HO0b.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/FHgZvw9.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.1\r\nBrowser: | EdgeChromium\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List\r\nOther extensions used: | Built-in Windows Security only; no other AVs or browser-extensions","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1215458644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-08-15T17:33:45Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

данные запрос в Журнале фильтрации отображаются как Modified Metadata. Вот адрес запроса, из-за модификации которого не работает нормально логин:\r\n```\r\nhttps://web.np.playstation.com/api/settings/v2/users/me/settings?settings=PersonalizedRecommendations,PersonalizedAds\r\n```\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nЗатем при открытии Account Settings из-за модификации этого запроса появляется ошибка:\r\n```\r\nhttps://accounts.api.playstation.com/api/v1/accounts/me/communication\r\n```\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nПри попытке открыть настройки Profile в разделе PlayStation Network начинается бесконечная перезагрузка страницы из-за модификации этого запроса:\r\n```\r\nhttps://web.np.playstation.com/api/basicProfile/v1/profile/users/me\r\n```\r\n\r\nНо после его добавления в исключения страница всё ещё перезагружалась бесконечно, но появились новые запросы:\r\n```\r\nhttps://web.np.playstation.com/api/communicationRestrictionStatus/v3/users/me/communication/restriction/status\r\nhttps://accounts.api.playstation.com/api/v2/verifiedAccounts/me\r\nи другие...\r\n```\r\n\r\nПоэтому я добавил такие исключения, чтобы мне было проще:\r\n```\r\n@@web.np.playstation.com/api^$stealth\r\n@@accounts.api.playstation.com/api^$stealth\r\n```\r\n\r\nИ стал искать дальше, что ещё взывает перезагрузку страницы.
