Issue URL (Ads)\r\n [http://www.youtube.com](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com)\r\n### Comment\r\n> DNS-фильтрация по пользовательскому списку не работает. При переключении протоколов с  DoQ на DoH и обратно, все как бы работает и блокируется, но спустя некоторое время (2-20 минут) перестает фильтровать. Вкратце что происходит: фильтрация на DoQ--> обрыв--> переключение на DoH--> кратковременная фильтрация-->обрыв-->переключение обратно на DoQ-->опять кратковременная фильтрация-->опять обрыв. Перезагрузка интернета чаще всего ничего не дает, если был обрыв допустим на DoH, то при переподключении интернета фильтрация происходить не будет, только опять смена протокола. Пробовал: 1) Отключение брандмауэра, антивируса нет 2) Переустановка сертификата в настройках Adguard 3) Сброс кэша DNS 4) Переустановка браузера 5) Ввод ip (использую Adguard DNS) в браузере и системе.
