Какой-то из последних фильтров ломает авторизацию на Aliexpress. На втором скриншоте после ввода логина и пароля иногда появляется captcha, где нужно провести бегунком слева-направо. Не знаю, при каких обстоятельствах появляется эта captcha, но теперь у меня она не появляется, потому что я авторизовался с выключенным AdGuard. Повторная авторизация не показывает «капчи». Сломана не сама форма авторизации, а captcha, после ввода которой процесс авторизации не завершается, окно с введёнными логином и паролем не исчезает, повторные вводы «капчи» не дают результата.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/kiReeP8.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/pdsBDw9.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.11\r\nBrowser: | Yandex\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Flash, <br>Block Java, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties (aliexpress.ru)\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>Legitimate URL Shortener, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133409/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1298321789","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133409#issuecomment-1298321789","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133409","id":1298321789,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85NYtF9","user":{"login":"zloyden","id":33488229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg4MjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33488229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden","html_url":"https://github.com/zloyden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zloyden/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-01T10:25:25Z","updated_at":"2022-11-01T10:25:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@lucelem попробуйте эти правила \r\n```\r\n@@||passport.aliexpress.com^$stealth\r\n@@||aliyun.com/nocaptcha/$stealth\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1298321789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-11-01T10:25:26Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Какой-то из последних фильтров ломает авторизацию на Aliexpress. На втором скриншоте после ввода логина и пароля иногда появляется captcha, где нужно провести бегунком слева-направо. Не знаю, при каких обстоятельствах появляется эта captcha, но теперь у меня она не появляется, потому что я авторизовался с выключенным AdGuard. Повторная авторизация не показывает «капчи». Сломана не сама форма авторизации, а captcha, после ввода которой процесс авторизации не завершается, окно с введёнными логином и паролем не исчезает, повторные вводы «капчи» не дают результата.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/kiReeP8.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/pdsBDw9.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.11\r\nBrowser: | Yandex\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Block Location API, <br>Block Flash, <br>Block Java, <br>Hide your Referrer from third-parties (aliexpress.ru)\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>Legitimate URL Shortener, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133409/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1298446508","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133409#issuecomment-1298446508","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133409","id":1298446508,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85NZLis","user":{"login":"lucelem","id":56886365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODg2MzY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56886365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucelem","html_url":"https://github.com/lucelem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucelem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucelem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucelem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucelem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucelem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucelem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucelem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucelem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucelem/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-01T12:34:52Z","updated_at":"2022-11-01T12:34:52Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> @lucelem попробуйте эти правила с включенным антитрекингом.\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> @@||passport.aliexpress.com^$stealth\r\n> @@||aliyun.com/nocaptcha/$stealth\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nТо же самое.
