@kuchacoda\r\n> Здравствуйте. Помогите пожалуйста решить проблему конфликтов фильтра AdGuard Russian FIlter.\r\n> Мы уже неоднократно замечали, что это правило ломает плеер в определенных случаях:\r\n> \r\n> /:\\/\\/([a-z-]{6}\\.)?(?!aniqit)[a-z0-9]{4,}\\.(com|in\\.net|link|tech|ru)/$xmlhttprequest,domain=aniqit.com|kodik.info|start.u-cdn.top|ustore.bz|u-stream.in\r\n> \r\n> В этоп правиле домены плеера это только aniqit.com и kodik.info. Остальные это уже другие плееры и не знаю почему они все в одном правиле.\r\n> \r\n> Суть в том, что при определенном стечении обстоятельств (возможно это зависит от конкретного поддомена CDN, который отдается при скачивании видео) блокировщик рекламы блокирует не только рекламу, но и само видео.\r\n> \r\n> Вообще данное правило лично для меня выглядит очень сложным и я не до конца понимаю как оно рабоатет, но мне кажется именно домены aniqit.com и kodik.info можно из него спокойно убрать, так как вся реклама в плеере Kodik блокируется множеством других правил. А конкретно это правило я видел только в случаях, когда пользователи жаловались на то, что у них не работает плеер (и у самого также случались такие проблемы).\r\n> \r\n> Буду очень благодарен, если вы можете решить данную проблему.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/9y5AJzy.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/fzQQIQt.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/07hZryj.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | uBlock Origin AdGuard Russian Filter\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nFilters: | <b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/128521/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/128521/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-09-07T13:45:50Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

anti-adblock message is basing on timezone (not only), but in this case it doesn't matter if ad blocker is enabled or not, anti-adblock notice is displayed anyway.\r\nThese

Maybe it has something to do with the way that Apple had updated their Operating System these past few weeks?  I don't know, but I do know that Publishers Clearing House had a lot of issues on their games on the Apple iPhones, but I didn't hear of any on the Apple MacBookPro specifically.    \r\n> \r\n> I copied the image address of one of the ads in a different sweepstakes that they have and it says:\r\n> \r\n> https://public.servenobid.com/creatives/MzAweDYwMC0yLmpwZ18xMDk4\r\n> \r\n> I don't  know what this even means.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/vV9Z54d.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/uVCgpGh.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.7\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances\r\nOther extensions used: | Norton™ 360 with LifeLock™ Ultimate Plus","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/128959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/128959/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1239421786","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/128959#issuecomment-1239421786","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/128959","id":1239421786,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85J4BNa","user":{"login":"Oniqqqq","id":38912221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTEyMjIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38912221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oniqqqq","html_url":"https://github.com/Oniqqqq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oniqqqq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oniqqqq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oniqqqq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oniqqqq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oniqqqq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oniqqqq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oniqqqq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oniqqqq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oniqqqq/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-07T13:52:44Z","updated_at":"2022-09-07T13:52:44Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"@jellizaveta i also think this domain can be used for loading ads.
