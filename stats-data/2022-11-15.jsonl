I received an interesting heads-up from [an owner of *Dakar Desert Rally* on PCGamingWiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Topic:X6von2hsqay3oswt), who claimed to have encountered ads in hub areas and startlines, but who allegedly found a way to block them. The supposed info was interesting enough that I'm forwarding it near-verbatim without actually having tested it myself, for the purposes of e.g. AdGuard for Windows and AdGuard DNS Filter.\r\n\r\nThe entries they suggested were:\r\n```\r\n||anzusafeframe.azureedge.net^\r\n||assets.anzuinfra.com^\r\n||caps-server.anzu.io^\r\n||emqx.anzuinfra.com^\r\n||events.anzuinfra.com^\r\n||l1-1.anzu.io^\r\n||logic.anzuinfra.com^\r\n||mgw-2.anzuinfra.com^\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther than this, the provided details were somewhat sparse, including if they used any other entries/filters for anything.\r\n\r\n3.
