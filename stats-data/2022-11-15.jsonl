I received an interesting heads-up from [an owner of *Dakar Desert Rally* on PCGamingWiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Topic:X6von2hsqay3oswt), who claimed to have encountered ads in hub areas and startlines, but who allegedly found a way to block them. The supposed info was interesting enough that I'm forwarding it near-verbatim without actually having tested it myself, for the purposes of e.g. AdGuard for Windows and AdGuard DNS Filter.\r\n\r\nThe entries they suggested were:\r\n```\r\n||anzusafeframe.azureedge.net^\r\n||assets.anzuinfra.com^\r\n||caps-server.anzu.io^\r\n||emqx.anzuinfra.com^\r\n||events.anzuinfra.com^\r\n||l1-1.anzu.io^\r\n||logic.anzuinfra.com^\r\n||mgw-2.anzuinfra.com^\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther than this, the provided details were somewhat sparse, including if they used any other entries/filters for anything.\r\n\r\n3.

False Positive of Social Annoyance at Immersive Fox\r\nI work at Immersive Fox (http://immersive-fox.com and http://dev.immersive-fox.com) and some filters are blocking a core functionality of our website. We do not have any social annoyances at all, but we do have a share-icon to allow users to share they generated video.\r\n\r\nI will create a PR to suggest a fix to allow any class with name share-icon in immersive-fox domain.\r\n\r\n2.

False Positive of Social Annoyance at Immersive Fox\r\nI work at Immersive Fox (http://immersive-fox.com and http://dev.immersive-fox.com) and some filters are blocking a core functionality of our website. We do not have any social annoyances at all, but we do have a share-icon to allow users to share they generated video.\r\n\r\nI will create a PR to suggest a fix to allow any class with name share-icon in immersive-fox domain.\r\n\r\n2.

Describe the issue in detail until it is absolutely clear from the screenshot what the problem is\r\n\r\n    Our site is a platform that allow users to generate video in couple of minutes. After that user can share the video or download. With Social Annoyance on on Adguard and Unblock, the share icon is hidden from user. Since it is not the expected behaviour since is a core functionality, I am submitting this PR. Please review it and see if you agree too. \r\n    \r\n    Our service is paid for and therefore we do not have ads or social annoyances.\r\n\r\n### Terms\r\n\r\n- [x] By submitting this issue, I

False Positive of Social Annoyance at Immersive Fox\r\nI work at Immersive Fox (http://immersive-fox.com and http://dev.immersive-fox.com) and some filters are blocking a core functionality of our website. We do not have any social annoyances at all, but we do have a share-icon to allow users to share they generated video.\r\n\r\nI will create a PR to suggest a fix to allow any class with name share-icon in immersive-fox domain.\r\n\r\n2.

issue is a simple one: The expected behavior is for the \"Continue\" button to redirect to a subreddit or profile labeled as \"NSFW\", which triggers this warning page. With AdGuard enabled pressing \"Continue\" results in an endless loop, it never redirects. I don't have any NSFW-specific rules or filtes set. I did not include a second screenshot demonstrating a proper redirect (with AdGuard off) for obvious reasons. The link itself is what prefaces the age-verification page after tapping an NSFW profile or subreddit, it does not link any NSFW content. To test simply visit any NSFW profile or subreddit using the https://old.reddit.com/ URL with AdGuard enabled. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/uVrWaBG.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/RNZID0q.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nPlatform: | Android 13 11/5 Security Update\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Android v4.0 nightly 35 (79)\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard mode: | VPN\r\nFiltering quality: | High-quality\r\nHTTPS filtering: | enabled\r\nStealth mode options: | \r\nDNS filtering: | server: `AdGuard DNS (Default)`<br>filters: `AdGuard DNS filter (Default)`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Extra\r\n\r\nDisable AMP","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/134815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/134815/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-11-15T14:02:23Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

False Positive of Social Annoyance at Immersive Fox\r\nI work at Immersive Fox (http://immersive-fox.com and http://dev.immersive-fox.com) and some filters are blocking a core functionality of our website. We do not have any social annoyances at all, but we do have a share-icon to allow users to share they generated video.\r\n\r\nI will create a PR to suggest a fix to allow any class with name share-icon in immersive-fox domain.\r\n\r\n2.
