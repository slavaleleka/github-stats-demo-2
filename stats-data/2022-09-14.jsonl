Comment\r\nUsername: @KaterynaSergiienko\r\n> Hi! :) \r\n> \r\n> I'm a tech lead with Wix.com QA team, and we have received multiple reports from our users about some functionality of our platform not working when your ad blocking tools are enabled. As far as I can see, this affects our site builder regardless of the specific user's site. \r\n> \r\n> Wix website builder is for registered accounts only, so you won't be able to reproduce using the link in the report. But here's a test account you can use to verify (go to https://www.wix.com and log in):\r\n> \r\n> login: testing4adguard@gmail.com\r\n> PW: testingEditorWithAdguard\r\n> \r\n> Test site: https://editor.wix.com/html/editor/web/renderer/edit/15694c34-6e74-4550-a694-f82311035628?metaSiteId=c185b54b-9703-4bf7-9d56-a895e52c8747 \r\n> \r\n> Just open the test site and click the \"+\" button on the left to see the issue. \r\n> \r\n> I would greatly appreciate this functionality to not be treated as ads, as it's really not - or any information on what exactly is triggering the block, so we can improve our product and avoid it that way. \r\n> \r\n> Thank you for your help. \r\n> \r\n> Regards,\r\n> Kathy - QA at Wix\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/M2JWWTc.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/CSNlVGe.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.22\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian, <br/>AdGuard Chinese, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>EasyList Hebrew\r\nOther extensions used: | None, and we got a bunch of complaints on this from other people","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/129682/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/129682/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1246611167","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/129682#issuecomment-1246611167","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/129682","id":1246611167,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85KTcbf","user":{"login":"BlazDT","id":34266271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjY2Mjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34266271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT","html_url":"https://github.com/BlazDT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-14T11:12:18Z","updated_at":"2022-09-14T11:12:18Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If something else still not working after update, we need step-by-step how to reproduce.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1246611167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-09-14T11:12:18Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

@NUser2018\r\n> Часть (но не все, во всяком случае пока!) сервисов Яндекса и\\или бывших сервисов Яндекса (например, таких как погода, новости и включая даже заглавную страницу, но возможно и некоторые другие сервисы, все не проверял конечно!) переехали с привычного адреса yandex.ru на новый адрес dzen.ru из-за начала сотрудничества Яндекса с VK (бывший Вконтакте) (кстати слухи о передаче\\продаже части сервисов Яндекса Яндексом в пользу VK ходили давно и вот теперь они видимо получили и наглядное практическое подтверждение!). В связи с этим на страницах сервисов появились некоторые элементы, (новые и\\или которые ранее успешно блокировались Adguard) которые мешают раздражают и которые хорошо было бы заблокировать. Примеры показаны на скриншоте. Баннер (обозначен цифрой 1 на скриншоте) наверняка новый и был добавлен наверняка как раз в связи с переездом на новый адрес, другой баннер (обозначен цифрой 2 на скриншоте) вообще жутко навязчивый и мешает поскольку вообще не имеет привычного крестика\\кнопки для его закрытия (правда этот баннер пропадает сам по мере прокрутки содержимого страницы вниз, но всё-равно он жутко навязчивый и мешает, если есть возможность то лучше бы его конечно наверное заблокировать). Вообщем на самом деле наверное требуется довольно глубокий анализ сервисов Яндекса (особенно переехавших на новый адрес) и чистка от всей  появившейся в связи с этим возможной рекламы и\\или иных мешающих и раздражающих элементов. И возможно не обычными фильтрами Adguard а Adguard Extra. Ну тут уж соответсвующим специалистам из команды Adguard будет виднее конечно.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/IjORi9E.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.10.2\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.google/dns-query`<br>filters: `User+rules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://sso.dzen.ru/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsso.dzen.ru%2F)\r\nOther extensions used: | Kaspersky Internet Security 21 MR3 (21.3.10.391) (с патчем j)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1246933780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-09-14T15:23:32Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
