[syntax](https://kb.adguard.com/general/how-to-create-your-own-ad-filters) of this project;\r\n  - [x] I have performed a self-review of my own changes;\r\n  - [x] My changes do not break web sites, apps and files structure.\r\n\r\n### What problem does the pull request fix?\r\n\r\n  - [x] Missed ads or ad leftovers;\r\n  - [ ] Website or app doesn't work properly;\r\n  - [ ] AdGuard gets detected on a website;\r\n  - [ ] Missed analytics or tracker;\r\n  - [ ] Social media buttons — share, like, tweet, etc;\r\n  - [x] Annoyances — pop-ups, cookie warnings, etc;\r\n  - [ ] Filters maintenance.\r\n\r\n### What issue is being fixed?\r\n##### Enter the issue address: https://github.com/List-KR/List-KR/pull/357\r\n\r\nList-KR doesn't block annoyances by default.\r\nI am adding a rule to filter remaining self-promoting elements.\r\n\r\n### Add your comment and screenshots\r\n\r\n**1.** Comment\r\n\r\nIt's a kind of promotion that includes the intent of self-promotion and information about their platform.\r\nHowever, it's completely not related to what users want to see (it's a recipe), and its height is so big that users are being disturbed.\r\n\r\n**2.**
