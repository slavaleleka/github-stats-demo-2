Comment\r\nUsername: @bsitshort\r\n> There has always been an issue with ads on edge home screen. In the past it would filter them, but as you scroll down they would eventually come back. I could go to the adguard extension and click on it and without doing anything they would dissapear again. Rinse and repeat.  But in the last few weeks they aren't filtered at all.  When you try to block them manually, it blanks out the whole page. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/qmrBRsf.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.10.2\r\nBrowser: | Edge\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180)\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns-unfiltered.adguard.com/dns-query`<br>filters: `User+rules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard Japanese\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nOther extensions used: | Norton Security, Autoplay Stopper, Google Keep, Dark Reader","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/130500/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-10-03T09:18:27Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

like a plan.\r\nLet's put his on the backburner and **close it.**\r\nI can also not reproduce it on my own system (Win10, Chrome, same filters). The issue is on Win10 FireFox plugin. I don't understand why the browser that is used would matter.\r\nAdditionally on that customer browser, when opening the log it opens in the background. I have not found a way yet to open up the log and have it visible. Thus log details are tricky to get now.\r\n\r\nDoes this log issue sound familiar? Also only on this customer Firefox plugin.\r\nAnyway, close it and I'll get back to this.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1265189373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-10-03T09:41:59Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
