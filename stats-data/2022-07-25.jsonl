Проблема актуальна. Вы говорите о проблеме сайта и провайдера. Уверяю вас, что всё работает без расширения Adguard или с отключённым фильтром счётчиков и систем аналитики (Блокировать известные трекеры). Обратите внимание. Нажимаю на любую кнопку соцсети, регистрацию и тп. Выдаёт ошибку и возвращает на предыдущую страницу. Проверять можно без аккаунтов, если вы не знали. Ленитесь? Задумываюсь о переходе на другой блокировщик или терпеть рекламу.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/xaN8Sk0.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/fMiCly8.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.0.204\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode options: | Block WebRTC\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1193830292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-07-25T09:51:33Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
