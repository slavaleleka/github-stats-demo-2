Проблема актуальна. Вы говорите о проблеме сайта и провайдера. Уверяю вас, что всё работает без расширения Adguard или с отключённым фильтром счётчиков и систем аналитики (Блокировать известные трекеры). Обратите внимание. Нажимаю на любую кнопку соцсети, регистрацию и тп. Выдаёт ошибку и возвращает на предыдущую страницу. Проверять можно без аккаунтов, если вы не знали. Ленитесь? Задумываюсь о переходе на другой блокировщик или терпеть рекламу.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/xaN8Sk0.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/fMiCly8.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.0.204\r\nBrowser: | Firefox\r\nStealth mode options: | Block WebRTC\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1193830292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-07-25T09:51:33Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Instead I used my own (`mail.yahoo.com##._yb_entur._yb_ivirg`) which worked just fine when I clicked the Block button. When I refresh the page, though it shows up again. I will then do the same thing and use `mail.yahoo.com##._yb_entur._yb_ivirg` and it picks it up just fine.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/qrs2miJ.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.10.1\r\nBrowser: | Edge 103.0.1264.62 (Chromium-based)\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Flash\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.nextdns.io/f8729f/`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>EasyList, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>Legitimate URL Shortener, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nCustom filters: | E:\\GitHub\\Ad-Filters\\filters\\base.txt,<br>E:\\GitHub\\Ad-Filters\\filters\\annoyances.txt,<br>E:\\GitHub\\Ad-Filters\\filters\\discord-scams.txt,<br>\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js,<br>https://github.com/Anarios/return-youtube-dislike/raw/main/Extensions/UserScript/Return%20Youtube%20Dislike.user.js,<br>https://greasyfork.org/scripts/407466-unedit-and-undelete-for-reddit/code/Unedit%20and%20Undelete%20for%20Reddit.user.js,<br>C:\\Users\\chris\\Downloads\\youtube-nyan-cat-progress-bar-video-player-theme.user.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/124513/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/124513/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1194390231","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/124513#issuecomment-1194390231","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/124513","id":1194390231,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85HMPLX","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-25T17:30:36Z","updated_at":"2022-07-25T17:30:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"`mail.yahoo.com##body ._yb_entur._yb_ivirg` works fine with extension, nothing blinking.\r\n\r\nFor apps - please try `mail.yahoo.com#?#._yb_entur._yb_ivirg`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1194390231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-07-25T17:30:36Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Comment\r\n> Ook, now I see. @Alex-302, I'm sorry, maybe I was too annoyed and harsh in a my previous report. So I tried to open the site using VPN, Lantern, DE server, black screen gone. Then I tried to open the site using VPN server from here: https://freevpn4you.net/locations/sweden.php according to this instruction (from here: https://freevpn4you.net/instruction.php):\r\n> \r\n> For Windows:\r\n> Go to Start —> Settings.\r\n> Choose Network & Internet\r\n> in the Settings window.\r\n> Click on VPN button in the new window.\r\n> Choose Add a VPN connection.\r\n> In the new connection window, enter\r\n> all the info (the info is available on the server's page). Choose Windows (built-in)\r\n> for VPN provider, enter any Connection name you want, choose Automatic for VPN type, and for Type of sign-in info choose\r\n> User name and password.\r\n> Click Save.\r\n> In the system tray click on Network icon, choose your connection, and click Connect.\r\n> \r\n> Result is the same, no annoying black screen.\r\n> \r\n> And then I tried to open through another VPN server from here (location: russia): https://freevpn4you.net/locations/russia.php, using the same instruction from above with Windows built-in PPTP client.\r\n> \r\n> And here after Ctrl + F5 I saw that the black screen is BACK while using russian VPN server! Wow! (see screenshot)\r\n> \r\n> Is this site starting to get too smart (like wtf) to detect AdGuard differently in different jurisdictions/countries?\r\n> @Alex-302, could you (or someone else) please investigate this using demonstrated VPNs or any other using different locations (Germany, Sweden, US, russia, etc.)?\r\n> \r\n> Coz what I'm getting on screenshot is pretty real to me.
