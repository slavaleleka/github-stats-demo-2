Пользуюсь сайтом новостей rambler.ru и не могу настроить страницу новостей что бы rambler ек блокировал видео новости а так же некоторые из новостных фотографий.\r\n> Я стал искать причину через журнал фильтрации и облачный dns делал разблокировку возможных запрещающих правил пока не разблокировал в итоге все правила для rambler.но в итоге проблема не решилась.\r\n> Проблема решается только тогда.когда я полностью выключу блокировщик.Исходя из этого я убежден что rambler обнаруживает Adguard и работает только если его полностью отключить.\r\n> Могли бы дать рекомендацию как решить проблему или может возможно сможете сами посмотреть через AnyDesk\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

The strange thing is, the issue also occurs with AdGuard disabled. If I shutdown AdGuard it's working fine, though.\r\n> The newsletter from anwb.nl is using webpower.eu when you click on a link. Through webpower.eu you should reach the actual anwb.nl page, in the end. Also, omroepmax.nl is using webpower.eu when clicking on a newsletter link, and is giving me the same issue.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/9Nli91f.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/5w8PifF.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Mac v2.8.1.1140 release\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `sdns://AgAAAAAAAAAAAAAaZmQ2MzE1ZWYuZC5hZGd1YXJkLWRucy5jb20KL2Rucy1xdWVyeQ`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/mac_v2/filters/15.txt`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Legitimate URL Shortener<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard DNS<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Dutch\r\nUserscripts: | AdGuard Extra (url: https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js)\r\nOther extensions used: | none","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/122208/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/122208/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-06-18T14:11:59Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
