Please include this site as a false positive: https://www.emag.ro/ The main banners are not showing, when logged in my account, on a PC if Adguard protection is ON. This is a online store and they have great offers on that main banners and I would like to see it, in my browsers. I even used a reset on my PC for Adguard to cancel a hidden rule but it still not showing anything. \r\n> \r\n> Also, I think that it would be great that the Adguard assistant settings to also have a Unblock ad on this website option. I my case if I did push, by mistake, pushed the Block ad on this website and clicked on the main banner region I could easy and without any special knowledge undo my problem. That is why I've used the Adguard reset on my PC, but that did not worked. \r\n> \r\n> I saw that when I order something, sometimes when the pay section of the site is on display, on PC the screen is just white and I can't finish to process my payments. This I don't know if it's because of Adguard or not but it just became a problem in the past week, out of the blue.\r\n> \r\n> Thank you. Have a good day!\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/8d9w10V.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/9v1ISE3.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.10.2\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://www.emag.ro/history/shoppingdetails/265563020](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emag.ro%2Fhistory%2Fshoppingdetails%2F265563020)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/129752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/129752/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1249998689","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/129752#issuecomment-1249998689","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/129752","id":1249998689,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85KgXdh","user":{"login":"xenudone","id":113750165,"node_id":"U_kgDOBsewlQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/113750165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone","html_url":"https://github.com/xenudone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-17T04:42:21Z","updated_at":"2022-09-17T04:42:21Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> Hello, As far as I can see, most of these banners are loaded from ad servers, like `googlesyndication.com`, `doubleclick.net`, so it rather shouldn't be unblocked.\r\n> \r\n> I have added a rule (filters update should be available in 1-2 hours) which should cause that banners which are not loaded by ad servers should be displayed (like on a screenshot below), but clearing cache or refreshing website using `Ctrl+F5` might be required.\r\n> \r\n> Screenshot\r\n> If you want to see banners from ad servers then please disable protection on this website.\r\n\r\nSo I did disable protection, in Chrome, for this site, I've deleted the cookies and browsing data and I still only see those banners if I'm logged out on the eMag site.

Please include this site as a false positive: https://www.emag.ro/ The main banners are not showing, when logged in my account, on a PC if Adguard protection is ON. This is a online store and they have great offers on that main banners and I would like to see it, in my browsers. I even used a reset on my PC for Adguard to cancel a hidden rule but it still not showing anything. \r\n> \r\n> Also, I think that it would be great that the Adguard assistant settings to also have a Unblock ad on this website option. I my case if I did push, by mistake, pushed the Block ad on this website and clicked on the main banner region I could easy and without any special knowledge undo my problem. That is why I've used the Adguard reset on my PC, but that did not worked. \r\n> \r\n> I saw that when I order something, sometimes when the pay section of the site is on display, on PC the screen is just white and I can't finish to process my payments. This I don't know if it's because of Adguard or not but it just became a problem in the past week, out of the blue.\r\n> \r\n> Thank you. Have a good day!\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/8d9w10V.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/9v1ISE3.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.10.2\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://www.emag.ro/history/shoppingdetails/265563020](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emag.ro%2Fhistory%2Fshoppingdetails%2F265563020)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/129752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/129752/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1250033028","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/129752#issuecomment-1250033028","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/129752","id":1250033028,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85Kgf2E","user":{"login":"AdamWr","id":29142494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQyNDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29142494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamWr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-17T09:01:32Z","updated_at":"2022-09-17T09:01:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"If I'm not wrong, this website display different banners when it \"detects\" ad blocker and I see few banners with AdGuard enabled.\r\n<details><summary>Screenshot</summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29142494/190848088-81ea2191-fd1a-4e12-9fc0-940d3284f271.png)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nWhat happens if do not disable protection and clear website cache and update filters?\r\nDo you see some banners or not (like on a screenshot above)?\r\n\r\nThese blocked banners are loaded from `doubleclick.net`/`googlesyndication.com` and are embedded in iframes, so technically they are Google ads.\r\n<details><summary>Screenshot</summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29142494/190848976-ac8505ae-337f-45e3-a6f0-d051116be0f7.png)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nYou can try to add these rules:\r\n```adblock\r\n@@||emag.ro^$urlblock,elemhide\r\n@@||tpc.googlesyndication.com^$domain=safeframe.googlesyndication.com\r\n```\r\nto user rules.

Please include this site as a false positive: https://www.emag.ro/ The main banners are not showing, when logged in my account, on a PC if Adguard protection is ON. This is a online store and they have great offers on that main banners and I would like to see it, in my browsers. I even used a reset on my PC for Adguard to cancel a hidden rule but it still not showing anything. \r\n> \r\n> Also, I think that it would be great that the Adguard assistant settings to also have a Unblock ad on this website option. I my case if I did push, by mistake, pushed the Block ad on this website and clicked on the main banner region I could easy and without any special knowledge undo my problem. That is why I've used the Adguard reset on my PC, but that did not worked. \r\n> \r\n> I saw that when I order something, sometimes when the pay section of the site is on display, on PC the screen is just white and I can't finish to process my payments.

Please include this site as a false positive: https://www.emag.ro/ The main banners are not showing, when logged in my account, on a PC if Adguard protection is ON. This is a online store and they have great offers on that main banners and I would like to see it, in my browsers. I even used a reset on my PC for Adguard to cancel a hidden rule but it still not showing anything. \r\n> \r\n> Also, I think that it would be great that the Adguard assistant settings to also have a Unblock ad on this website option. I my case if I did push, by mistake, pushed the Block ad on this website and clicked on the main banner region I could easy and without any special knowledge undo my problem.

Please include this site as a false positive: https://www.emag.ro/ The main banners are not showing, when logged in my account, on a PC if Adguard protection is ON. This is a online store and they have great offers on that main banners and I would like to see it, in my browsers. I even used a reset on my PC for Adguard to cancel a hidden rule but it still not showing anything. \r\n> \r\n> Also, I think that it would be great that the Adguard assistant settings to also have a Unblock ad on this website option. I my case if I did push, by mistake, pushed the Block ad on this website and clicked on the main banner region I could easy and without any special knowledge undo my problem. That is why I've used the Adguard reset on my PC, but that did not worked. \r\n> \r\n> I saw that when I order something, sometimes when the pay section of the site is on display, on PC the screen is just white and I can't finish to process my payments. This I don't know if it's because of Adguard or not but it just became a problem in the past week, out of the blue.\r\n> \r\n> Thank you.

Please include this site as a false positive: https://www.emag.ro/ The main banners are not showing, when logged in my account, on a PC if Adguard protection is ON. This is a online store and they have great offers on that main banners and I would like to see it, in my browsers. I even used a reset on my PC for Adguard to cancel a hidden rule but it still not showing anything. \r\n> \r\n> Also, I think that it would be great that the Adguard assistant settings to also have a Unblock ad on this website option. I my case if I did push, by mistake, pushed the Block ad on this website and clicked on the main banner region I could easy and without any special knowledge undo my problem. That is why I've used the Adguard reset on my PC, but that did not worked. \r\n> \r\n> I saw that when I order something, sometimes when the pay section of the site is on display, on PC the screen is just white and I can't finish to process my payments. This I don't know if it's because of Adguard or not but it just became a problem in the past week, out of the blue.\r\n> \r\n> Thank you. Have a good day!\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/8d9w10V.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/9v1ISE3.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.10.2\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://www.emag.ro/history/shoppingdetails/265563020](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emag.ro%2Fhistory%2Fshoppingdetails%2F265563020)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/129752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/129752/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1250036187","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/129752#issuecomment-1250036187","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/129752","id":1250036187,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85Kggnb","user":{"login":"xenudone","id":113750165,"node_id":"U_kgDOBsewlQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/113750165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone","html_url":"https://github.com/xenudone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xenudone/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-17T09:20:30Z","updated_at":"2022-09-17T09:20:30Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> AdGuard also supports `redirect-rule`, but I don't understand how it might help in this case, because these banners are technically ads.

Please include this site as a false positive: https://www.emag.ro/ The main banners are not showing, when logged in my account, on a PC if Adguard protection is ON. This is a online store and they have great offers on that main banners and I would like to see it, in my browsers. I even used a reset on my PC for Adguard to cancel a hidden rule but it still not showing anything. \r\n> \r\n> Also, I think that it would be great that the Adguard assistant settings to also have a Unblock ad on this website option. I my case if I did push, by mistake, pushed the Block ad on this website and clicked on the main banner region I could easy and without any special knowledge undo my problem. That is why I've used the Adguard reset on my PC, but that did not worked. \r\n> \r\n> I saw that when I order something, sometimes when the pay section of the site is on display, on PC the screen is just white and I can't finish to process my payments. This I don't know if it's because of Adguard or not but it just became a problem in the past week, out of the blue.\r\n> \r\n> Thank you. Have a good day!\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/8d9w10V.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/9v1ISE3.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.10.2\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/assistant/4.3/assistant.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://www.emag.ro/history/shoppingdetails/265563020](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emag.ro%2Fhistory%2Fshoppingdetails%2F265563020)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/129752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/129752/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1250035251","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/129752#issuecomment-1250035251","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/129752","id":1250035251,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85KggYz","user":{"login":"AdamWr","id":29142494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MTQyNDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29142494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr","html_url":"https://github.com/AdamWr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AdamWr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-17T09:14:32Z","updated_at":"2022-09-17T09:14:32Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"AdGuard also supports `redirect-rule`, but I don't understand how it might help in this case, because these banners are technically ads.\r\nAlso I don't understand what's the reason about writing about other ad blockers in this issue, it's not related and not helpful at all.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1250035251/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-09-17T09:14:32Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
