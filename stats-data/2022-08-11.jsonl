。有时候在不能正常屏蔽这种广告的页面刷新一下可能就正常屏蔽了但是也会出现刷新了还是没有屏蔽的情况。强制刷新F5也是一样，非常薛定谔。同类广告屏蔽扩展我也试过 都是一样。难道就没有解决的办法吗？ 麻烦开发者看能不能解决，谢谢。\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n

。有时候在不能正常屏蔽这种广告的页面刷新一下可能就正常屏蔽了但是也会出现刷新了还是没有屏蔽的情况。强制刷新F5也是一样，非常薛定谔。同类广告屏蔽扩展我也试过 都是一样。难道就没有解决的办法吗？ 麻烦开发者看能不能解决，谢谢。\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n

。有时候在不能正常屏蔽这种广告的页面刷新一下可能就正常屏蔽了但是也会出现刷新了还是没有屏蔽的情况。强制刷新F5也是一样，非常薛定谔。同类广告屏蔽扩展我也试过 都是一样。难道就没有解决的办法吗？ 麻烦开发者看能不能解决，谢谢。\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n

。有时候在不能正常屏蔽这种广告的页面刷新一下可能就正常屏蔽了但是也会出现刷新了还是没有屏蔽的情况。强制刷新F5也是一样，非常薛定谔。同类广告屏蔽扩展我也试过 都是一样。难道就没有解决的办法吗？ 麻烦开发者看能不能解决，谢谢。\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n

。有时候在不能正常屏蔽这种广告的页面刷新一下可能就正常屏蔽了但是也会出现刷新了还是没有屏蔽的情况。强制刷新F5也是一样，非常薛定谔。同类广告屏蔽扩展我也试过 都是一样。难道就没有解决的办法吗？ 麻烦开发者看能不能解决，谢谢。\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n

。有时候在不能正常屏蔽这种广告的页面刷新一下可能就正常屏蔽了但是也会出现刷新了还是没有屏蔽的情况。强制刷新F5也是一样，非常薛定谔。同类广告屏蔽扩展我也试过 都是一样。难道就没有解决的办法吗？ 麻烦开发者看能不能解决，谢谢。\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n

。有时候在不能正常屏蔽这种广告的页面刷新一下可能就正常屏蔽了但是也会出现刷新了还是没有屏蔽的情况。强制刷新F5也是一样，非常薛定谔。同类广告屏蔽扩展我也试过 都是一样。难道就没有解决的办法吗？ 麻烦开发者看能不能解决，谢谢。\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n
