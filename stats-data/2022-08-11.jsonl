。有时候在不能正常屏蔽这种广告的页面刷新一下可能就正常屏蔽了但是也会出现刷新了还是没有屏蔽的情况。强制刷新F5也是一样，非常薛定谔。同类广告屏蔽扩展我也试过 都是一样。难道就没有解决的办法吗？ 麻烦开发者看能不能解决，谢谢。\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n

。有时候在不能正常屏蔽这种广告的页面刷新一下可能就正常屏蔽了但是也会出现刷新了还是没有屏蔽的情况。强制刷新F5也是一样，非常薛定谔。同类广告屏蔽扩展我也试过 都是一样。难道就没有解决的办法吗？ 麻烦开发者看能不能解决，谢谢。\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n

。有时候在不能正常屏蔽这种广告的页面刷新一下可能就正常屏蔽了但是也会出现刷新了还是没有屏蔽的情况。强制刷新F5也是一样，非常薛定谔。同类广告屏蔽扩展我也试过 都是一样。难道就没有解决的办法吗？ 麻烦开发者看能不能解决，谢谢。\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n

。有时候在不能正常屏蔽这种广告的页面刷新一下可能就正常屏蔽了但是也会出现刷新了还是没有屏蔽的情况。强制刷新F5也是一样，非常薛定谔。同类广告屏蔽扩展我也试过 都是一样。难道就没有解决的办法吗？ 麻烦开发者看能不能解决，谢谢。\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n

。有时候在不能正常屏蔽这种广告的页面刷新一下可能就正常屏蔽了但是也会出现刷新了还是没有屏蔽的情况。强制刷新F5也是一样，非常薛定谔。同类广告屏蔽扩展我也试过 都是一样。难道就没有解决的办法吗？ 麻烦开发者看能不能解决，谢谢。\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n

。有时候在不能正常屏蔽这种广告的页面刷新一下可能就正常屏蔽了但是也会出现刷新了还是没有屏蔽的情况。强制刷新F5也是一样，非常薛定谔。同类广告屏蔽扩展我也试过 都是一样。难道就没有解决的办法吗？ 麻烦开发者看能不能解决，谢谢。\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n

。有时候在不能正常屏蔽这种广告的页面刷新一下可能就正常屏蔽了但是也会出现刷新了还是没有屏蔽的情况。强制刷新F5也是一样，非常薛定谔。同类广告屏蔽扩展我也试过 都是一样。难道就没有解决的办法吗？ 麻烦开发者看能不能解决，谢谢。\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n

。有时候在不能正常屏蔽这种广告的页面刷新一下可能就正常屏蔽了但是也会出现刷新了还是没有屏蔽的情况。强制刷新F5也是一样，非常薛定谔。同类广告屏蔽扩展我也试过 都是一样。难道就没有解决的办法吗？ 麻烦开发者看能不能解决，谢谢。\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n

。有时候在不能正常屏蔽这种广告的页面刷新一下可能就正常屏蔽了但是也会出现刷新了还是没有屏蔽的情况。强制刷新F5也是一样，非常薛定谔。同类广告屏蔽扩展我也试过 都是一样。难道就没有解决的办法吗？ 麻烦开发者看能不能解决，谢谢。\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n

solution\r\n\r\n创建一个过滤器，拦截有关于登陆的类似内容，但是千万不要过滤网站预设的登录窗口，一般网站预设好的常规登录入口一般嵌入在网站的顶栏或者底部（底部已经比较少了，放在其他位置的网站应该会少之又少，所以还是建议你们在创建过滤器之前浏览大量网页看看它们的常规登录入口都在哪里\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n这种内容一般出现在中文网站上，所以应该对中文网做优化。注意！千万不要过滤网站预设好的常规登录入口！如果常规过滤入口被过滤器拦截，那么大家都将不能登录网站！","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/126321/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/126321/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1212253225","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/126321#issuecomment-1212253225","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/126321","id":1212253225,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85IQYQp","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-11T17:02:13Z","updated_at":"2022-08-11T17:02:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Please

Changes my DNS to `one.one.one.one` in Android's settings.\r\n\r\n5. Restarts Spotify on phone.\r\n\r\n6. Songs start to download, songs playing in other machines suddenly appears, past scrobbles are submitted to Last.fm and can be seen in my profile.\r\n\r\n##### Other details:\r\n\r\n1. I have a cookie in adguard-dns.io that says `user:\"32362--\"`\r\n\r\n2. Searching for Spotify blocked queries in statistics shows nothing in the past 7 days: https://adguard-dns.io/en/dashboard/statistics/query?limit=20&statuses%5B0%5D=REQUEST_BLOCKED&statuses%5B1%5D=RESPONSE_BLOCKED&companies%5B0%5D=spotify&retention=DAYS_7\r\n\r\n3.
