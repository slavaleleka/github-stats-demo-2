Comment\r\nUsername: @tox1c90\r\n> I think I understand now what the problem is that in some cases Bing ads are slipping through. Just noticed by chance that ALL of my search results are served as IMAGES/blobs instead of text. Only the headlines and URLs can be selected and copied as text, the actual preview of each result including the \"ad\" marker is contained in an image object, if you try to select the text with your mouse/cursor one actually drags the whole thing around.\r\n> This is not only the case for ads, but for all search results when Adguard is enabled.\r\n> \r\n> In inPrivate mode of the browser, this does not happen, and all search results are served as proper selectable text. And then, Adguard is able to block all ads.\r\n> \r\n> So the ads are obviously not missed by the filter, but it's Bing running some kind of Adblock detection, which switches the way search results are delivered from text mode to small inline images/snippets/blobs.\r\n> \r\n> Anything one can do to get around this? Better way of hiding Adguard?\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/RuaiVmm.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/tkZXG28.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/bgFJI5O.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.11\r\nBrowser: | Edge 106.0.1370.52 (Chromium-based)\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>AdGuard Experimental<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard German\r\nUserscripts: | https://greasyfork.org/scripts/5357-remove-google-results-redirect/code/Remove%20Google%20Results%20Redirect.user.js,<br>https://greasyfork.org/scripts/18450-steam-bypass-age-confirmation-prompts/code/Steam:%20Bypass%20age%20confirmation%20prompts.user.js,<br>https://greasyfork.org/scripts/383093-twitch-disable-automatic-video-downscale/code/Twitch%20-%20Disable%20automatic%20video%20downscale.user.js,<br>C:\\Users\\marti\\OneDrive\\Anwendungen\\Adguard\\Youtube%201440p.user.js,<br>https://nightdev.com/betterttv/other/betterttv.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-wot/1.0/wot.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://www.bing.com/search?q=fritz+dect+302&cvid=cf581884581c4bc88fd942687290bf5c&aqs=edge.1.69i60j69i59j0j69i57j69i59j0l2j69i60l2.1289j0j9&PC=U531&first=1&FORM=PERE](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bing.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dfritz%2Bdect%2B302%26cvid%3Dcf581884581c4bc88fd942687290bf5c%26aqs%3Dedge.1.69i60j69i59j0j69i57j69i59j0l2j69i60l2.1289j0j9%26PC%3DU531%26first%3D1%26FORM%3DPERE)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133445/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-11-04T07:46:47Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

постоянно, на сайте прямым текстом написано, что если вы используете блокировщики рекламы, сайт будет виснуть. Мне это надоело, я решила полазить в настройках вашего приложения, вдруг найду что-то полезное. Наклацала непонятно что, вроде вернула все обратно, но теперь вылезла проблема - законные две рекламы вернулись к моим просмотрам сериалов и фильмов. При этом на самом сайте много всплывающих окон и баннеров, их по прежнему не видно. Что я наклацала не знаю, в самом сафари расширение включено, с настроек все включено, если в приложение зайти то там стоит защита сафари включена. А по факту лажа. Хелп, сама я не могу разобраться. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/YrLbTIG.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard/AdGuard Pro for iOS v4.4.4\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133505/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133505/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1303218514","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133505#issuecomment-1303218514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133505","id":1303218514,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85NrYlS","user":{"login":"adguard-bot","id":30082422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDgyNDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30082422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/adguard-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adguard-bot/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-04T10:18:02Z","updated_at":"2022-11-04T10:18:02Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"\r\n### Issue URL (Incorrect Blocking)\r\n [https://rezka.ag/](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Frezka.ag%2F)\r\n### Comment\r\n> При включенном AdGuard нет возможности транслировать видео через airplay.

постоянно, на сайте прямым текстом написано, что если вы используете блокировщики рекламы, сайт будет виснуть. Мне это надоело, я решила полазить в настройках вашего приложения, вдруг найду что-то полезное. Наклацала непонятно что, вроде вернула все обратно, но теперь вылезла проблема - законные две рекламы вернулись к моим просмотрам сериалов и фильмов. При этом на самом сайте много всплывающих окон и баннеров, их по прежнему не видно. Что я наклацала не знаю, в самом сафари расширение включено, с настроек все включено, если в приложение зайти то там стоит защита сафари включена. А по факту лажа. Хелп, сама я не могу разобраться. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/YrLbTIG.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard/AdGuard Pro for iOS v4.4.4\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133505/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/133505/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-11-04T10:18:01Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
