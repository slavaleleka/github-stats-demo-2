Looks like FINALLY somebody was able to REPRODUCE the g-d damn black screen issue and fix it! And @Alex-302, I hope that maybe next time when you 'Cannot reproduce' some issue you could try to offer to fix it to someone else from AdGuard team rather than slap the stupid label and do nothing, twice.\r\n> \r\n> Alright, with big annoying black screen problem now gone I noticed another, see screenshot.\r\n> \r\n> Hope you could REPRODUCE and nail it. Thanks.\r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/0DSiyXd.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.10.2\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Block Location API\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.google/dns-query`<br>filters: `https://filters.adtidy.org/windows/filters/15.txt, User rules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-wot/1.0/wot.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://gaypornhdfree.com/?s](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgaypornhdfree.com%2F%3Fs)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1205913193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-08-05T00:36:11Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Per entrambe le app, come si vede dagli screenshot, quando è attivo AdGuard, lo streaming non si carica, anche con i filtri attivi al minimo.  Con le altre piattaforme nessun problema anche con AdGuard attivo. Grazie in anticipo.
