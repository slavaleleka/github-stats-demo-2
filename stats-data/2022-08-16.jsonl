Prerequisites\n\n- [X] This site DOES NOT contains sexually explicit material, otherwise use [NSFW-specific form](./new?template=bug_report_NSFW.yml);\n- [X] Filters were updated before reproducing an issue;\n- [X] AdGuard product version is up-to-date;\n- [X] Browser version is up-to-date;\n- [X] If the site or app is broken, disabling AdGuard protection resolves an issue.\n\n### What product do you use?\n\nAdGuard DNS\n\n### AdGuard version\n\nadguard-dns.io\n\n### What type of problem have you encountered?\n\nWebsite or app doesn't work properly\n\n### Which browser(s) do you use?\n\nthe problem is with app, not a site\n\n### Which device do you use?\n\nMobile\n\n### Where is the problem encountered?\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spotify.music\n\n### What filters do you have enabled?\n\nAdGuard DNS filter\n\n### What Stealth Mode options do you have enabled?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add your comment and screenshots\n\n##### To reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. With my DNS set to `c6-----.d.adguard-dns.com` in Android's settings.\r\n\r\n2. Open Spotify on the phone while playing songs on another device, it does not show the current playing song or controls for changing it. It does not download any song.\r\n\r\n3. Put something to play on the phone itself, then I don't see any new scrobbles on https://www.last.fm/user/PeHLC (even after songs ends).\r\n\r\n##### To temporarily fix it:\r\n\r\n4. Changes my DNS to `one.one.one.one` in Android's settings.\r\n\r\n5. Restarts Spotify on phone.\r\n\r\n6. Songs start to download, songs playing in other machines suddenly appears, past scrobbles are submitted to Last.fm and can be seen in my profile.\r\n\r\n##### Other details:\r\n\r\n1. I have a cookie in adguard-dns.io that says `user:\"32362--\"`\r\n\r\n2. Searching for Spotify blocked queries in statistics shows nothing in the past 7 days: https://adguard-dns.io/en/dashboard/statistics/query?limit=20&statuses%5B0%5D=REQUEST_BLOCKED&statuses%5B1%5D=RESPONSE_BLOCKED&companies%5B0%5D=spotify&retention=DAYS_7\r\n\r\n3.

Hello, I'm a Korean.\r\n> First, as I am not good at English I hope you understand well.\r\n> I have a trivial problem in mobile Edge inside Secure Folder, which is supported by Samsung Electronics.\r\n> I recently found the folder very useful.\r\n> But although I already had installed Adguard in my cell phone, all apps inside the folder showed me ads.\r\n> I found I need to install Adguard there again.\r\n> I logged in and registered the license.\r\n> And then, most apps didn't show me ads there.\r\n> But some websites still did in mobile Edge and Chrome, despite Adguard.\r\n> I attached a screenshot in the previous step.\r\n> What I wanna say is the websites didn't show me ads outside the folder, but if inside the folder, they still did.\r\n> I don't know my words made you understand.\r\n> I'm looking forward to your replies.\r\n> Have a good day!\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot

если что я обычный пользователь и не имею отношения к команде AdGuard, просто я также отправлял репорты с формами подписки на рассылки, но их не блокировали в футере, так как там они мешают контенту, как отвечали разработчики фильтров AdGuard.\r\n\r\nНо на скриншоте выше вы выделили кнопки на соцсети, которые указаны как способы связи для сообщения новости редакции, а блокируют обычно кнопки для того, чтобы поделиться контентом в соцсетях, а не прямые ссылки на соцсети, насколько я знаю. Ну и лично мне кажутся эти кнопки полезными.
