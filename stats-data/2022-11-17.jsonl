Comment\r\nUsername: @benbails\r\n> It should be clear that there are two ads that come up on the right-hand side, but there's also an issue where ads pop up when I click the media player. Since I couldn't screenshot that, I thought I would mention it here. Also, my Youtube is playing ads too, but my main issue is this one here in the screenshot. Thank you so much for your help!!\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/EnZSRrk.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.4\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/135049/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/135049/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1318896635","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/135049#issuecomment-1318896635","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/135049","id":1318896635,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85OnMP7","user":{"login":"benbails","id":118361391,"node_id":"U_kgDOBw4NLw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/118361391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benbails","html_url":"https://github.com/benbails","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benbails/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benbails/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benbails/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benbails/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benbails/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benbails/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benbails/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benbails/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benbails/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-17T16:31:48Z","updated_at":"2022-11-17T16:31:48Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"> > Do you think there's something wrong with AdGuard itself?\r\n> \r\n> It is possible.
