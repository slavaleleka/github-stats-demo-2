Afterward,  YouTube worked perfectly. Later that day, the problem arose again. I have deleted all user rules for YouTube and the problem still persists.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/BqJPDX9.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/Gk7eP3s.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.7\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances\r\nOther extensions used: | N/A","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1311176128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-11-11T03:10:57Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Adguard стал пропускать рекламу в Живом Журнале. Очень много рекламы от Сбера, но и другие объявления тоже попадаются. Началось где-то около месяца назад (октябрь 2022). Фильтры обновляю вручную почти каждый день, Adguard Extra включен. В чем может быть причина?

I really appreciate the assistance. Is everyone testing this on iOS 16.1, using Safari, on m.Facebook.com? With anything other than the default AdGuard settings? I cleared the cache/cookies. That got rid of the images for the “sponsored” posts, but I still get these in the attached image, and the website still bounces around while scrolling. It has been acting like this since AdGuard 4.4.4 for  iOS was released, and nothing I’ve seen suggested, nor the suggestions from AdGuard support have fixed the issue. That’s why they directed me here.
