Но всё же жаль что только так, в прошлом году Вам удалось удачно всё совместить так чтобы и кнопки заработали и лишней информации не появилось. И добавить это штатно в общий фильтр для всех пользователей. :( Теперь что-то поменялось, что-то по другому, чем отличается от прошлого раза? Добавил указанные Вами правила в свой пользовательский фильтр и протестировал, заметил только два всплывающих окна (на данном сайте, на других не проверял): одно из них вообще рекламирует Adguard (говорю же сайт - Ваш партнёр), другое предлагает тем или иным способом подписаться на рассылку от сайта о новых (легальных) акциях на различное ПО\\сервисы. Но в целом я понимаю что это всё-равно раздражает, тем более всех других пользователей. В любом случае спасибо за Вашу помощь. Наверное буду держать эти правила у себя в пользовательском фильтре, но выключенными, и включать только когда будет необходимость воспользоваться этими кнопками на данном сайте.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1163136636/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-06-22T13:59:44Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
