Comment\r\n> I face this issue while i have the DNS protection on, i stop receiving this error when i disable the feature, this is caused when tiktok website tries to redirect me to the actual app, the error is caused in safari and chrome as these are the only browsers i use. \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot
