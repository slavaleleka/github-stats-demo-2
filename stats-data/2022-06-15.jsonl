And even using a DNS filter on my iPad Pro 12.9 inch 2nd Generation running on iPad OS 15+ is still unable to block or filter many of the ads that still appear.

just realized about this issue and completely agree with you on this. I've reviewed the policy, but still, blocking just a tiny part of the video for a few seconds does not justify keeping such important information away from a consumer. \r\n\r\nImagine this scenario: a person who knows a bit about computer set up an adblocker for their friend and family member, or enable the filter on their own computer. They trusted this filter because it's from a reputable company, and they would not think that such an important consumer information would be considered so annoying that they'd be worth blocking, unlike something like cookie pop-ups. \r\n\r\nNow they will not know whether or not a product was given to a YouTube creator for free and/or the creator was paid to make the video unless if the creator is ethical enough to also inform them inside the video and didn't think \"I marked the video as paid promo, nothing more I need to do.\" (Creator space is currently unregulated in many regions & they can easily get away with it)\r\n\r\nNow their minds are influenced by sponsored content, even if the creator use the option to put a disclosure up for their audience.\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be strange if an adblock filter blocks all the paid disclosures from a news website while still leaving the article up for the user to read, now without knowing if the article is actually paid for? \r\nSomething like this should be in a much more niche filter, not a relatively standard ones like this.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, it'd be a great idea to clearly state that this filter is going to block a banner informing the user when a content is sponsored by someone so people knows what they're getting into.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1155832929/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-06-15T00:18:17Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

description\n\nWhile running a custom DNS server I was able to block all ads in the waze app by blocking any connections from advil.waze.com\r\n\r\n^ This should help you block all ads from the app.\r\n\r\nI'm currently using your iOS DNS profile & your private DNS servers on Android, would really appreciate it if you could add this to your blocklist.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd advil.waze.com to the SDNS filter\n\n### Additional information\n\nCRM ID:

description\n\nWhile running a custom DNS server I was able to block all ads in the waze app by blocking any connections from advil.waze.com\r\n\r\n^ This should help you block all ads from the app.\r\n\r\nI'm currently using your iOS DNS profile & your private DNS servers on Android, would really appreciate it if you could add this to your blocklist.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd advil.waze.com to the SDNS filter\n\n### Additional information\n\nCRM ID:

Since an update about 3 weeks ago, whenever I try to access the leaflet (the supermarket catalogue) from within the app get a network error. If I revert the phone to my ISP DNS, the app works normal, so I guess it is a bad AdGuard filter. Can you please fix it?

description\n\nWhile running a custom DNS server I was able to block all ads in the waze app by blocking any connections from advil.waze.com\r\n\r\n^ This should help you block all ads from the

description\n\nWhile running a custom DNS server I was able to block all ads in the waze app by blocking any connections from advil.waze.com\r\n\r\n^ This should help you block all ads from the app.\r\n\r\nI'm currently using your iOS DNS profile & your private DNS servers on Android, would really appreciate it if you could add this to your blocklist.\n\n### Proposed solution\n\nAdd advil.waze.com to the SDNS filter\n\n### Additional information\n\nCRM ID:
