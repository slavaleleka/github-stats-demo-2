it's not a typo.\r\nHere - `https://param.com.tr/en/` is used `param.com.tr/en/dist/js/gdpr-cookie.js`, so a rule like this:\r\n```\r\n||param.com.tr/dist/js/gdpr-cookie.js\r\n```\r\nwill be not block it.\r\n\r\nAlternatively something like this:\r\n```\r\n/dist/js/gdpr-cookie.js$domain=param.com.tr\r\n```\r\nalso would be okay, but I think that it's not necessary to change current rule.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1228295028/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-08-26T09:50:49Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
