it's not a typo.\r\nHere - `https://param.com.tr/en/` is used `param.com.tr/en/dist/js/gdpr-cookie.js`, so a rule like this:\r\n```\r\n||param.com.tr/dist/js/gdpr-cookie.js\r\n```\r\nwill be not block it.\r\n\r\nAlternatively something like this:\r\n```\r\n/dist/js/gdpr-cookie.js$domain=param.com.tr\r\n```\r\nalso would be okay, but I think that it's not necessary to change current rule.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1228295028/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-08-26T09:50:49Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

This infinite redirect loop doesn't stop until I turn off adguard for vodefone.hu domain.\r\n> \r\n> Once turned off, the browser stops on https://auth.vodafone.hu/oxauth/auth/login-captcha.htm URL where I'm required to enter my credentials. Once I enter my credentials, an error page appears telling me the login was unsuccessful. I have to turn off adguard for auth.vodafone.hu subdomain as well, and only then can I login to the website with success.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/Dy0sjla.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/Sh8oceL.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 3</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 3](https://reports-img.adguard.com/HoMexGj.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.10.2\r\nBrowser: | Brave\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Push API, <br>Block Flash, <br>Block Java\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `quic://219b99ca.d.adguard-dns.com`<br>filters: `User+rules`\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>Hungarian\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js\r\nReferrer: | [https://www.vodafone.hu/magyar](https://adguardteam.github.io/AnonymousRedirect/redirect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vodafone.hu%2Fmagyar)\r\nOther extensions used: | Bitwarden password manager.

Then the browser enters an infinite redirect loop, from https://www.vodafone.hu/myvodafone to  https://auth.vodafone.hu/oxauth/auth/login-captcha.htm  and repeat. This infinite redirect loop doesn't stop until I turn off adguard for vodefone.hu domain.\r\n> \r\n> Once turned off, the browser stops on https://auth.vodafone.hu/oxauth/auth/login-captcha.htm URL where I'm required to enter my credentials. Once I enter my credentials, an error page appears telling me the login was unsuccessful.

This infinite redirect loop doesn't stop until I turn off adguard for vodefone.hu domain.\r\n> \r\n> Once turned off, the browser stops on https://auth.vodafone.hu/oxauth/auth/login-captcha.htm URL where I'm required to enter my credentials. Once I enter my credentials, an error page appears telling me the login was unsuccessful.

This infinite redirect loop doesn't stop until I turn off adguard for vodefone.hu domain.\r\n> \r\n> Once turned off, the browser stops on https://auth.vodafone.hu/oxauth/auth/login-captcha.htm URL where I'm required to enter my credentials.
