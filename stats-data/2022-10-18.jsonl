Comment\r\nUsername: @tox1c90\r\n> When I am logged in to Bing with my Microsoft account, I'm receiving tons of search ads whenever I search for something that resembles the name of a product (e.g., \"iPhone 14\" also works).\r\n> When I search for the same phrase using the inPrivate-mode of the Edge browser (where I am not logged in with my account), all of these ads are gone (they reappear though when Adguard is disabled, so it's not due some built-in tracking protection of the inPrivate mode). \r\n> \r\n> Could you please check what is going on when using Bing in the \"logged in\"-state?\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/wsl8ztl.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n
