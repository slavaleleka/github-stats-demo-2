when I wait like 20-30 seconds it MAY appear. But also disappear again when scrolling around.\r\nWhen testing around, I can't say for sure, it's cause by Base filter. I can't reliable reproduce by disable filter one by one.\r\nBut what works for sure 100% is disableing AG entirely.\r\n\r\nWhats also may be interesting, the issue is only with the \"Flammendes Käthchen\" page. The https://www.mein-schoener-garten.de/pflanzen/alpenveilchen/zimmer-alpenveilchen always works fine with AG and Firefox.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1190058920/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-07-20T09:41:47Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
