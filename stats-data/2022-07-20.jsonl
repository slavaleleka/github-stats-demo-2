when I wait like 20-30 seconds it MAY appear. But also disappear again when scrolling around.\r\nWhen testing around, I can't say for sure, it's cause by Base filter. I can't reliable reproduce by disable filter one by one.\r\nBut what works for sure 100% is disableing AG entirely.\r\n\r\nWhats also may be interesting, the issue is only with the \"Flammendes Käthchen\" page. The https://www.mein-schoener-garten.de/pflanzen/alpenveilchen/zimmer-alpenveilchen always works fine with AG and Firefox.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1190058920/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-07-20T09:41:47Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Sobald ich Adquard ausschalte werden die Videos abgespielt. Das alte Ticket wurde geschlossen mit der Hinweis das der Fehler behoben wurde....., joa ganze 2 Tage oder so denn wie man feststellen kann funktioniert die Wiedergabe erneut nicht mehr. Ob Gamestar ständig Veränderungen durchführt weiß ich nicht aber irgendetwas müsst ihr ja blocken das der Player auf der Seite nicht mehr reagieren will.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/FPygt25.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/hPfoJzI.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.0.204\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>ABPVN List\r\nOther extensions used: | Avira Antivir","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/124915/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/124915/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1190247019","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/124915#issuecomment-1190247019","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/124915","id":1190247019,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85G8bpr","user":{"login":"BlazDT","id":34266271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjY2Mjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34266271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT","html_url":"https://github.com/BlazDT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlazDT/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-20T12:49:59Z","updated_at":"2022-07-20T12:49:59Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Disabled rule, video plays fine now: https://www.gamestar.de/videos/saints-row-vorschau-video-zum-open-world-actionspiel,121069.html\r\nI am not seeing any ads @AdamWr ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1190247019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-07-20T12:49:59Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Sobald ich Adquard ausschalte werden die Videos abgespielt. Das alte Ticket wurde geschlossen mit der Hinweis das der Fehler behoben wurde....., joa ganze 2 Tage oder so denn wie man feststellen kann funktioniert die Wiedergabe erneut nicht mehr. Ob Gamestar ständig Veränderungen durchführt weiß ich nicht aber irgendetwas müsst ihr ja blocken das der Player auf der Seite nicht mehr reagieren will.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/FPygt25.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 2</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 2](https://reports-img.adguard.com/hPfoJzI.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.0.204\r\nBrowser: | Chrome\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard French, <br/>AdGuard German, <br/>AdGuard Dutch, <br/>AdGuard Spanish/Portuguese, <br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>ABPVN List\r\nOther extensions used: | Avira Antivir","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/124915/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/124915/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-07-20T12:20:02Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
