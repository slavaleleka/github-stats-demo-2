Instead I used my own (`mail.yahoo.com##._yb_entur._yb_ivirg`) which worked just fine when I clicked the Block button. When I refresh the page, though it shows up again. I will then do the same thing and use `mail.yahoo.com##._yb_entur._yb_ivirg` and it picks it up just fine.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/qrs2miJ.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Windows v7.10.1\r\nBrowser: | Edge 103.0.1264.62 (Chromium-based)\r\nAdGuard driver: | WFP\r\nStealth mode options: | Hide your search queries, <br>Send Do-Not-Track header, <br>Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests, <br>Strip URLs from tracking parameters, <br>Self-destructing third-party cookies (180), <br>Block WebRTC, <br>Block Flash\r\nDNS filtering: | server: `https://dns.nextdns.io/f8729f/`<br>\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>EasyList, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>Legitimate URL Shortener, <br/>AdGuard URL Tracking, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Security:</b><br/>Online Malicious URL Blocklist, <br/>NoCoin Filter List<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>EasyList Italy, <br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nCustom filters: | E:\\GitHub\\Ad-Filters\\filters\\base.txt,<br>E:\\GitHub\\Ad-Filters\\filters\\annoyances.txt,<br>E:\\GitHub\\Ad-Filters\\filters\\discord-scams.txt,<br>\r\nUserscripts: | https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/adguard-extra/1.0/adguard-extra.user.js,<br>https://userscripts.adtidy.org/release/popup-blocker/2.5/popupblocker.user.js,<br>https://github.com/Anarios/return-youtube-dislike/raw/main/Extensions/UserScript/Return%20Youtube%20Dislike.user.js,<br>https://greasyfork.org/scripts/407466-unedit-and-undelete-for-reddit/code/Unedit%20and%20Undelete%20for%20Reddit.user.js,<br>C:\\Users\\chris\\Downloads\\youtube-nyan-cat-progress-bar-video-player-theme.user.js","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/124513/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/124513/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-07-16T13:09:31Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
