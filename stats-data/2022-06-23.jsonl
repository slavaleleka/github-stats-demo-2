@AdamWr ! \r\nThanks for quick reply, but unfortunately it doesn't work.\r\nLet me explain what is the issue.\r\n\r\nPlayer inside uses sha256 hash function in order to get hash of text being used to audio processing.\r\nSo some reason, when your plugin is enabled - hash calculation is wrong (please see attached video), and audio can't be played.\r\n\r\nIt's not always 100% reproducible for all pages, but for some reason it has high rate of reproduction for jpost.com\r\n\r\nInformation that might help you:\r\nWe use `hash.js/lib/hash/sha/256.js` v1.1.7 from https://www.npmjs.com/package/hash.js\r\n\r\nWe have suspicion, that code from your plugin might override some standard JS code or might intersect with other part of code - that might lead to such results.\r\n\r\nAlso please note, it's not reproducible for simple text, but for real one as in example provided above.\r\nSo far it's unique case for us, since we didn't had anything like that before.\r\n\r\nIf you need  more detail - please let me know, I'll try to help you.\r\n\r\nThanks!
