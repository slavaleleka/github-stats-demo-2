Per entrambe le app, come si vede dagli screenshot, quando è attivo AdGuard, lo streaming non si carica, anche con i filtri attivi al minimo.  Con le altre piattaforme nessun problema anche con AdGuard attivo. Grazie in anticipo.

Comment\r\n> @Alex-302, I'm sorry, but the problem is not gone. If you can't reproduce it, could you please let somebody else from AdGuard team to try? This time I'm trying to give even more details. First I recorded a gif displaying the issue and then I saved the problematic page as a single .html file. I don't understand why exactly the page works differently for different locations or it's something else but the problem is real. I hope saved page's source code could help you solve it.

All other filters work perfectly (Ads, Social Widgets, Trackers, etc). I verified it one by one. The problem is exclusively with AdGuard Annoyances Filter. And only with the Content Blocker, the Advanced Blocker works fine (Advanced rules). My guess would be that one rule with unsupported syntax managed to bypass the Safari Filter Converter (one one rule contains unsupported syntax, the whole filter stops working). Perhaps this has to do with AdGuard recent change where the Annoyances Filter was split into different categories.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/nHwVr1y.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard for Safari v1.11.6\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nFilters: | <b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/125746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/125746/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1201440375","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/125746#issuecomment-1201440375","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/125746","id":1201440375,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85HnIZ3","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-01T16:33:16Z","updated_at":"2022-08-01T16:33:16Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Hi.
