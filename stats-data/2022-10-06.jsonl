In the other words it's like, impossible for 1 user to visit all websites. So I have a suggestion about it and i would like to report this suggestion for you devs.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThis suggestion is:\r\n\r\n**User-specific global filter list system**. (I think it would be better if this list was separate from the existing user rules.)\r\n\r\nBy the way, for this system, getting data directly from the server and processing at the same time for such a number of users may be under heavy load for server, I don't know. You devs know what is best.\r\n\r\nSo is something like this possible?:\r\n\r\nSome kind of caching of the AdGuard global filter on user devices. So global filter list on the server > Global filter cache update on users devices > user specific filter list made by client. The goal here is to convert server processes to > client processes. The server just updates the cache global filter list. The point here is that it is set by the Adguard client with the global filter in the cache to set the user specific filter rules.\r\n\r\nWith 2 option settings in AdGuard client:\r\n\r\n**Automatic**:\r\n\r\nAutomatic adding from the global filter list in the cache for the specific-user custom filter list for sites visited by user.\r\n\r\n**Manual**:\r\n\r\nManual adding with the client from the global filter list in the cache for the specific-user custom filter list for sites visited by user.\r\n\r\nLike this suggestion it probably won't pass the 10k number of filter rules for the user-specific. In this case, it can save a huge load in terms of performance for devices.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nAs end user, i feel that such a suggestion is not possible according to the filter rule structure. Still, I think it's better than nothing in terms of information. I like to thank you for interest in advance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/131364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/131364/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1270093540","html_url":"https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/131364#issuecomment-1270093540","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/131364","id":1270093540,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAVlsM85LtBbk","user":{"login":"Alex-302","id":8361299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjEyOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302","html_url":"https://github.com/Alex-302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Alex-302/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-06T13:53:20Z","updated_at":"2022-10-06T13:53:20Z","author_association":"MEMBER","body":"Only generic element hiding and CSS rules can affect performance(millions:) ).
